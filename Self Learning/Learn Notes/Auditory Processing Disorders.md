> [!info]- Auditory Processing Disorders
> In a growing population of young adults with hearing disabilities ranging from tinnitus to auditory processing disorder (APD), it is clear that considerations need to be made. For the accessibility of a new group to be potentially become stranded in a world were one must rely on making sense of the auditory world they are surrounded by, to fit in and thrive in society.

I myself sometimes do not understand what the hell is being said. With Christopher Nolan such a thing is intentional, and subtitles affect immersion. When Listening to Kendrick, who uses a heavy Atlantan accent to represent his culture, sometimes lyrics are needed to actually understand his prose and poetry.

> > - [[Inclusion]]: Such people with Auditory processing issues; what kinds of accessibility would be required? much of our accessibility needs to be tangible to have any semblance of effect in the perception of society and action of govt or council to help accommodate. Such issues affect ability to socialise in public, work in crowded busy spaces, impede auditory learning (where presentations primarily use auditory descriptions to elaborate and teach in lectures and seminars)

> > - [[Equity]], [[DEI]], [[Social Value]]: It can be argued that if social media consumption and scree addiction leads to such a resulting disability, it was essentially brought upon by the "victim" of the disorder. Contradicting this, it can also be said that many would not be aware of such dangers when engaging with a product designed to engage your attention and immerse you. As a consumer it is the job of authority to keep us safe. As there are no health warnings how is a person to know? At the same time we should be responsible enough as adults to realise and at least make the effort to explore the dangers
