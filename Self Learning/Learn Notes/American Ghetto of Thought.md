Because to call it a "school" of thought wouldn't truly encapsulate the clusterfuck that American culture is experiencing right now:

Echo Chamber
Double standards
Wilful ignorance
Selective Apathy
"Rules for thee but not for me"
Intolerance and hate using "Free Speech" as a shield

Thank you for shaping the US voter base, Rupert Murdoch. You've truly outdone yourself over the years. I never imagined so many people would believe themselves to be so intelligent and yet not ever think for themselves, Until opening reddit in January and February 2025. I knew there were many, but the sheer number is astounding. They aren't even aware what's wrong with their own decisions and thoughts, the poor idiots. They can't even stop to think and question themselves because they rely on perceived authorities' thought pieces to form their own opinions and biases.
