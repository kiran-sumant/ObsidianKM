# Things to Prepare for:

- [ ] My ass being handed to me
- [ ] mass-spec-based proteomics
- [ ] lots of R-based data processing
- [ ] developing the platelet interactome map through experimental proof

# Our Spin:

- Potentially modelling Interactions?? 
- Statistical analysis/incorporation of modelling and/or new data vis techniques in the existing dataset
- Exploration of differentials: what happens if illness?
