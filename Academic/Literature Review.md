## Connecting MAGPs, and EMI domain PTM through EGF-like domain binding

Appears to be no linkage in symptoms between MAGP-1 and MMRN1 deficiency some overlapping in functional pathways
- MMRN1 loss impairs platelet adhesion and vessel occlusion, but not wound repair (similar to wild type/ not statistically significant difference)
- MAGP1 loss leads to inefficient fat metabolism, haematopoiesis, impaired wound repair, osteopenia
- MAGP2 loss decreases levels of neutrophils in circulation.

# Hypotheses/Aims (spaghetti at the wall)

Aim: Investigate potential mechanisms by which EMI O-fucosylation helps play a key role in MMRN1 secretion, and propose its effects in other proteins when we confirm they contain the same domain modification
