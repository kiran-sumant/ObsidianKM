# Relevant Facts from Literature by Topic

# Fucosylation


[[FUT10 and FUT11 are novel protein O-fucosyltransferases that modify protein EMI domains]]


## [[Elastin Microfibril Interface (EMI)]]


## Software for Novel Protein Search/Discovery

[[ColabFold making protein folding accessible to all]]


[[Fast and accurate protein structure search with Foldseek]]
### How it was used, the way we want to use it


## Notch Signalling Pathway



# Hypotheses/Aims (spaghetti at the wall)

Aim: Investigate potential mechanisms by which EMI O-fucosylation helps play a key role in MMRN1 secretion, and propose its effects in other proteins when we confirm they contain the same domain modification
