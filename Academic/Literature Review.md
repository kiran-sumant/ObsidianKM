# Relevant Facts from Literature by Topic

# Fucosylation

[[The evolution of post-translational modifications]]$\checkmark$ 

[[Protein O-fucosylation structure and function]]$\checkmark$ 

[[Biological functions of fucose in mammals]]$\checkmark$

> [!warning] Importantey
> - Does the EMI domain contain an EGF adjacent motif? 
> - Is there a possible evolution link between either TSF or EGF and EMI domain?

# Hypotheses/Aims (spaghetti at the wall)

Aim: Investigate potential mechanisms by which EMI O-fucosylation helps play a key role in MMRN1 secretion, and propose its effects in other proteins when we confirm they contain the same domain modification
