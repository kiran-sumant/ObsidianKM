# How to Design a Successful Research Project

## What constitutes a successful research project?
- answers a **well defined**, **valuable** research question.
- give information or confirm information that helps ==bridge a knowledge gap==
- Data in the project is **shared with stakeholders** (for proteomics it'll be other researchers)

The [[FINER]] research question

Design question so that disproving hypothesis is an answer in and of itself that can be concluded well **within the project's scope**.

==CONTEXT:== make sure to spend about 30% of your presentation

Consider the use of statistics in results.
**probability of detecting a difference between study groups when a true difference exists** (p-value)
Don't want to 
- underpower (study too small to identify important differences), or
- overpower (becomes non-meaningful sensitivity)

Research plan requires **controls** in methodology. What is being used as a control, what caveats are being addressed?

Picking a journal to apply for publishing requires evaluation:
- ..


Take home messages
- Start writing your thesis today
- ==bullet points in thesis doc, leave writing for later==
- Can't control everything, but plan: use Gantt chart
- Surrounded by experts
- Scientific writing is **iterative**
- keep track of ==all materials and methods== use lab archives
