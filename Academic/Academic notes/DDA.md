Data Dependent Acquisition
not to be confused with [[DIA]], as DDA is **more 

- Used fragment ions targeted at random
- Chooses based on abundance to fragment specific ions
- Best suited for **providing identification results and PTM evidence**
- Workflow as follows:
	1. Specific peptides selected for fragmentation
	2. Peptides fragmented, ==*one at a time*==
	3. Library of identified fragments generated for analysis/sequencing.
