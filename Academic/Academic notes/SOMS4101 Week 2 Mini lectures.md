# Extracting Analytes from Biological Matrix
## Organic Extraction
- We are interested in changes of *primary* and *secondary metabolites*
- processes (analysis pipeline)
	1. Extracting analytes
	2. Separating analytes
	3. Detecting Analytes
	4. Processing and Interpreting Data
- Use solvents and gases to analyse complex mixture

| Gases | Solvents |
| ----- | -------- |
|       | Small molecules (==100-500 g/mol==)         |
|       |          |
Ideally, proteins and nucleic acids ***not of interest*** are ==insolutble in our chosen gas/solvent==. Removed by Filtration/centrifugation

## Solid Phase Extraction
- First step of liquid chromatography
- Uses ***resin*** binding to ==small organic compounds== but ==not to salts==

Don't forget that solvents might alter metabolites, processing time is important, metabolism changes metabolites, and fractionation or extraction can be used to obtain target analytes.
