# Extracting Analytes from Biological Matrix
## Organic Extraction
- We are interested in changes of *primary* and *secondary metabolites*
- processes (analysis pipeline)
	1. Extracting analytes
	2. Separating analytes
	3. Detecting Analytes
	4. Processing and Interpreting Data
- Use solvents and gases to analyse complex mixture

| Gases | Solvents |
| ----- | -------- |
|       | Small molecules (==100-500 g/mol==)         |
|       |          |
Ideally, proteins and nucleic acids ***not of interest*** are ==insolutble in our chosen gas/solvent==. Removed by Filtration/centrifugation

## Solid Phase Extraction
- First step of liquid chromatography
- Uses ***resin*** binding to ==small organic compounds== but ==not to salts==

Don't forget that solvents might alter metabolites, processing time is important, metabolism changes metabolites, and fractionation or extraction can be used to obtain target analytes.

# Separating analytes for Individual Analysis

Our conditions for separation of analytes depend upon:
- Hydrophilicity
- Lipophilicity
- [[LogP]]

At this point, primary and secondary metabolites extracted from cell. Need to analyse individually, remove DNA and undesired proteins.

Compounds to separate:
- Ions
- Macromolecules (nucleic acids, mRNA, all proteins, lipid bilayers)
- Metabolites, amino acids, sugars, hormones

## Chromatography
Examples::
- Size exclusion 
- Polarity-Based
- Affinity Chromatography (==for targeting specific proteins==)


Polarity + Affinity pipeline:
1. Condition
2. Load
3. Wash off undesired compounds
4. Elute desired compounds that end up binding to resin

Note to remember- Polarity based off of electric charge in a substructre in a molecule, **depends on electronegativity diff in atoms**.

**Polar** is ==Hydrophilic==
**Non-Polar** is ==Lipophilic==
[[LogP]] is an ==Important Indicator==

# Liquid Chromatography Basics

[[High-Performance Liquid Chromatography]] **(HP)LC**-MS

Chemistry of Mobile vs Stationary Phase interactions; strength of interaction determines which phase the analyte is drawn.

## Mobile phase:
- Composition; isocratic or gradient concentration/makeup?
Strength as eluent - ***[[solvent polarity index (P)]]***

We gon use da Masheeeeeennnnn
1. Can use/combine multiple solvents
2. Pumped in to column, along with *sample*
3. run thru HPLC column
4. detector acquires data
5.  boom

Note that ==detector can be any of the detectors, not just MS; e.g spectroscopy, UV, NMR==

***For the love of god, develop your method properly before starting the project holyyplease just check and double check with phd students and supervisor please and thanks***
