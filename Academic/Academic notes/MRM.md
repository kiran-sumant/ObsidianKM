Multiple reaction monitoring

#### see also **selective reaction monitoring (SRM)**, and ==Parallel Reaction Monitoring ([[PRM]])==

- highly specific, sensitive technique
- Robust and high throughput, but have a lower dynamic range compared to hother hi-res analysers.
- used to ==selectively quantify compounds== in complex mixtures
- uses ==QQQ MS==
- works as follows
	1. Parent ion (target compound) isolated
	2. Subsequent fragmentation
	3. Daughter ions **selected** for **quantitation**.


> [!warning] To note:
> significant chromatographic separation required (LC-MS)
