Multiple reaction monitoring; also **selective reaction monitoring (SRM)

- highly specific, sensitive technique
- used to ==selectively quantify compounds== in complex mixtures
- uses ==QQQ MS==
- works as follows
	1. Parent ion (target compound) isolated
	2. Subsequent fragmentation
	3. Daughter ions **selected** for **quantitation**.


> [!warning] To note:
> significant chromatographic separation required (LC-MS)
