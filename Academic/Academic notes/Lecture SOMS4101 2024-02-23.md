 Problems in the plot:
 - better to display legend with high risk and low risk stacked vertically and omit first risk title.
 - Time x label repeated, unnecessary
 - Risk "table" shows no unit for the values in the table 
 - might be better off transforming the number by colour to fit into above graph legend and then denote the units for the table itself.
 - Not seen on image, but figure caption can be way more informative.
