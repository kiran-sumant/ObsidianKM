## \1. Authorship Case Study A 

A senior academic has supervised an Honours student, who completed her thesis and has now left the University. The student did not have time to write a paper out of her project, so the senior academic instructs a research assistant (RA) in her group to write it after obtaining the Honours students’ permission. When the draft paper is almost finished, the academic emails the student to indicate that the research assistant will be listed as first author. No response is received and the academic assumes that this means the student consents. 

The RA sends the student the draft paper, which includes substantial material from the thesis and reflects its results directly. The RA is listed as first author, and the student is upset and refuses to agree to this. She claims she never received the email and should have been contacted by phone, since the academic had her number. 

The student acknowledges that the RA has spent a lot of time putting the paper together and agrees to have both authors listed as equal first, as long as the student’s name appears first. The RA requests that the student must complete 2 out of 3 items in a short timeframe to prepare the paper for submission in order to be listed as first author. The student completes the larger item but does not have time for the other. Both the RA and the student refuse to have the other listed as first author. 
**Questions for discussion:**
- How can this situation be resolved? 
*The student requires more leniency, as it is clear that hey are putting in the effort but the RA is making little concessions to allow leeway.*

- What are the requirements for authorship?
*A substantial contribution to either the paper's content, data acquisition, data analysis, critical review or integrity.*

- Do both the student and the RA satisfy them?
*Yes they do!*

- What steps should the student and supervisor have taken to ensure that the work is included in appropriate manuscript(s) and published successfully?
*Transparency and Communication.*


## 8. Data Management Case Study B

Dr Hart is a clinician and researcher, specialising in cardiology. She has access to a large database of patient records, including cardiac MRI scans. Dr Hart thinks that these scans could be very useful for future research, so she copies the database into the University of Sydney Research Data Store to ensure this data can be translated into vital future research. A few years later, when another researcher in Dr Hart’s lab tries to use the data for research, they can’t find any participant consent forms for the data. 
**Questions for discussion** 

- Can clinical data be used in research? 
*Yes provided that patients are aware of their data being used for research purposes, and their awareness is documented through informed consent documents with their signature included.*

- Is the way Dr Hart collected her data appropriate? What should she have done?
*No it's not. She should have obtained consent from the patients and had a doctor who has contact with the patient (preferably the doctor who requested their MRI) to affirm their informed consent.*

- What needs to be considered when storing data that involves individuals’ medical information?
Confidentiality, data security, data longevity (depending on format)

- What issues are present from a research data management perspective?
