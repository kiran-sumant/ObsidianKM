## \1. Authorship Case Study A 

A senior academic has supervised an Honours student, who completed her thesis and has now left the University. The student did not have time to write a paper out of her project, so the senior academic instructs a research assistant (RA) in her group to write it after obtaining the Honours students’ permission. When the draft paper is almost finished, the academic emails the student to indicate that the research assistant will be listed as first author. No response is received and the academic assumes that this means the student consents. 

The RA sends the student the draft paper, which includes substantial material from the thesis and reflects its results directly. The RA is listed as first author, and the student is upset and refuses to agree to this. She claims she never received the email and should have been contacted by phone, since the academic had her number. 

The student acknowledges that the RA has spent a lot of time putting the paper together and agrees to have both authors listed as equal first, as long as the student’s name appears first. The RA requests that the student must complete 2 out of 3 items in a short timeframe to prepare the paper for submission in order to be listed as first author. The student completes the larger item but does not have time for the other. Both the RA and the student refuse to have the other listed as first author. 
**Questions for discussion **
- How can this situation be resolved? 
- What are the requirements for authorship?
- Do both the student and the RA satisfy them?
- What steps should the student and supervisor have taken to ensure that the work is included in appropriate manuscript(s) and published successfully?
