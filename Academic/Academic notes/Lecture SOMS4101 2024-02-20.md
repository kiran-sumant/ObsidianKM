## What is expected:
- Draft report on Canvas due MONDAY 26TH!! 
- Tuesday 2nd April is main major assessment
- In-Class assessment due 19th March
- Use the module to develop skills in your data science practice, *not coding*
- We can share code for stuff, solve problems together, but ==research independently!!==
### Assessment Rubric
![[Pasted image 20240220093845.png]]
Will need coding snippets for reproducibility, helps them give feedback.

## Need to:
1. Choose methods to seek solutions from complex data
2. How machine learning is used in health and medical research
3. ==apply data scripts in R for complex analysis==
4. Utilised data vis to report on analysis

## Module Objectives
Best practice methods for Data analysis and visualisation in research reporting.

## Discussion

Consider the reading [[Tumour gene expression signature in primary melanoma predicts long-term outcomes]].
So yeah, the steps necessary to implement and justify data science techniques, especially something like machine learning models.


# PART 2

(workshop?) melanoma

- 4% of all skin cancers diagnoses (niche)
- Deadliest of all, 80% of derma cancer mortality rates.

[[biomarkers]] in medicine are considered for melanoma diagnoses + treatment plans.

==Prognostic== *and* ==predictive== means both giving information about ==patient outcome==, AND gives information on patient ==response to specific therapeutic intervention==.

Modern anti-cancer drugs are ==High-cost==, and both ==life-changing== and ==toxic==

See [[TRIPOD Statement]] for more about reporting on oncological and biomarker analysis.

## Hypothesis:

## Dataset

Usually Survivorship is analysed in *binary* (died before or after 5 years). Data of survivorship in readings above was measured as accurately as possible for time scale plotting as well.

patient samples and long-term clinical outcome data was used to train the
