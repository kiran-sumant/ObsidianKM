## Overview
1. State ***Problem***, either health, educational or technological
2. State ***gap in knowledge***
3. **Approach** must address/attempt to resolve knowledge gap
4. Present **[[Honours Aims and Hypotheses|aims and hypotheses]]**
 
> [!important]
> - Must grab their attention!
> - Must be able to understand the entire project from the first page.

> [!example] Significance
> - About 1/4 page
> - Needs to be stated quickly
> - **Start/end** with a ==punchy statement==.
> - Facts+figures **must be included** for relevance.
> - ==be ***specific*** but not boring==

> [!example] Gap in knowledge
> - Specify
> - Why does the gap exist

> [!example] Advertise your advantage in the project
> - Unique setting (mass spec direct access)
> - Access to patient samples (HUVEC)
> - Specialised Assays

> [!example] Approach Taken + Aims & Hypotheses
> - Approach can be part of [[Honours Aims and Hypotheses|aims and hypotheses section]].
> - A&H can be stated in either order
> - **Aims** start with =="to"==
> - **Hypotheses** must be ==definitive statements==. (*avoid should, could, may etc*)
> ***Aims must be well-linked to each other***

Create figure for experimental Pipeline to put on the first page.

## Background
1. Content
2. Relation to aims and hypothesis
3. [[Literature Review|Literature Consideration]]

> [!example] Contents
> - Expand on Significance if important
> - What Concepts do you need to cover?
> - ***Incorporate key literature*** related to the project, choose articles that are seminal and most up-to-date.

> [!warning] Important!!
> - ==***don't cite reviews***==

> [!important] Preliminary Data
> - Either background or research plan
> - Published findings aren't preliminary data. those must be summarised and referenced

## Research Plan
1. **Experimental Plan** described
2. ***Methodologies***
3. ***Expected outcomes*** must be explained and justified

> [!example] Aim
> - State the aim, weave in a bit of **approach** from overview
> - ==Use Figures/diagrams== wherever necessary to ==summarise methods==.

> [!example] Methodologies
> - Technology used
> - Diagram + text to show **how it work**
> - Justification

Expected outcomes are **optional**

# Tone, Grammar, etc.

- No "I", ***only "we"***
- For discussing previous findings from your lab that aren't part of your work, can say "**our research group has shown**"
- For research plan, saying "we" is a *must*.

Your research is mainly combination of **Dry Lab** and **Wet Lab**.
