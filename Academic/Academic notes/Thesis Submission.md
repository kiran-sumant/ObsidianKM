# Introduction and Aims


> [!info] There is an ideal use case for the following type of preliminary data and how to refer to them:
> 1. **Local Lab group**: "our preliminary data shows"
> 2. **Collaborating Lab/individual**: "Haltiwanger's data indicates"

# Methods
Consider:
- Sample size
- Controls; positive, negative, comparative
- ==All **relevant** experimental variables== per sample

Materials can be **separated** or **integrated** (integrated is preferred)
> [!NOTE] 
> Write in **discrete sections**, in ==past tense==.

# Results

**Narrative description** of findings, ==written around figures==.

- If you're showing individual peptide mass spec graphs, use the to refer to "confirmation of peptide profile", relate it back to using the EIC to **quantify** the fucosylation yield.

- Avoid talking about ==**statistically** insignificant results==. Those are the ones you're discussing, how do they address the aims? How does it all fit together?

- Avoid overuse of heavy specifics repetitively. ensure it's clearer and easy for the reader to read through but also understand.

## Figure Legends

All detail needed:
1. Exp conditions
2. Variable measured and how
3. sample number, perhaps justification
4. What statistics shown (boxplot, SEM, p-values)

# Discussion

- ==Do  not restate results!!==
- Rather, **begin** by relating results **back to aims**.
- explain unexpected results, how they may relate to previous literature
- related all results to previous literature

> [!important] Consider for all sentences in discussion
> **knowledge -> understanding -> argument-> critique**

Use to develop previous understandings/ add to previous preconceptions in the field, develop current knowledge in a constructive manner.

## Conclusion

- take home messages.
- **don't overstate your conclusions**, don't make claims on things suggested by data that aren't statistically significant.
- suggestions to make on future directions to develop what still isn't known from your data. ==Try that EGFL7-MFAP2 interaction for size?==
