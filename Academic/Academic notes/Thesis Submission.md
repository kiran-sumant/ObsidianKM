# Introduction and Aims

# Methods
Consider:
- Sample size
- Randomisation
- Controls; positive, negative, comparative
- ==All **relevant** experimental variables== per sample

Materials can be **separated** or **integrated** (integrated is preferred)
> [!NOTE] 
> Write in **discrete sections**, in ==past tense==.

# Results

**Narrative description** of findings, ==written around figures==.

- If you're showing individual peptide mass spec graphs, use the to refer to "confirmation of peptide profile", relate it back to using the EIC to **quantify** the fucosylation yield.

- Avoid talking about ==**statistically** insignificant results==. Those are the ones you're discussing, how do they address the aims? How does it all fit together?

- Avoid overuse of heavy specifics repetitively. ensure it's clearer and easy for the reader to read through but also understand.
