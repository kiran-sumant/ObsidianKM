# Main Idea of Thesis

[[Kinase]] 

Clinical kinase inhibitors are used for cancer therapy.

- categorised based on binding modes by type:
	1. ATP pocket in active state
	2. " " " " inactive state
	3. allosteric inhibitors, bind **non-competitively against ATP**
	4. ==interfere with prot-prot interactions.==

beeg probelm with mumbo number 4:

- kinases targets aren't fully known, outside metabolic/neurological targets. 
- *Toxicity is a risk.*

# Details/Quotes

Testing kinase inhibitor drugs for other cellular functions/ effects.

Using *biochemical kinase inhibition assays*
- Cellular shift thermal assay
- Thermal profiling of proteome
- RNAi-mediated knockdown of the identified target
- Kinase independent functions of kinases
