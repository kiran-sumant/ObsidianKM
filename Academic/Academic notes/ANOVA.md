**Single, continuous dependent variable**,
==+==
**Multi-level categorical independent variables**

Outcome variable is expressed as a function of explanatory variables.

## Types
1. One-way ANOVA

2. Two-way ANOVA

3. Repeated Measures ANOVA


## Assumptions


## Post-Hoc Analyses

- **[[Bonferroni]]**
- **[[Tukey's HSD]]**
- **[[Scheffe]]**

> [!info] Assumed for the base version of all tests:
> - **Independence** between and within groups, 
> - All groups are ==normally distributed==,
> - Variance is ==homogeneous==

| Analysis    | Data suitability                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bonferroni  | **Set of comparisons**                                                                    |
| Tukey's HSD | **Individual pairwise** comparisons, best for ==equal sample sizes==                      |
| Scheffe     | **All possible simple** and complex mean comparisons; ==highly conservative, largest CI== |
