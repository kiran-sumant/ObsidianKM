Tukey Test/procedure,  gives an ==Honest Significant Difference==, based on a **studentised range distribution.** The test compares **all possible pairs** of means.

ANOVA gives ==MSE==; MS error.

**q-value** is determined by the ==Q Table== using $k$ and $df$, which are number of groups and degrees of freedom, respectively.

> $T = q   \times \sqrt \frac{MSE}{n}$, where $n$ is the **number of items** in **one sample**
> 
> If ==$T \geq   \mid  \bar{x_{1}} - \bar{x_{2}}  \mid$==, the means are *significantly different*.



should I use this? - ![[ANOVA#^faa453]]
