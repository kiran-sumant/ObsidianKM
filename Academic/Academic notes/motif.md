Motif is a **short**, **conserved**, ==sequence of amino acids== with a ==specific function==. A motif can be found in **multiple proteins** and *may* perform *similar functions* (*example: zinc finger*).

It may not even be functional at all (*example: omega loop*)

> [!warning] 
> NOT to be confused with [[domain]] , which is **longer** and maintains a structure independent from the protein.
