# Main Idea of Thesis
- Project helped ==characterise the proteome== of human platelet **lysate** and **releasate**, processed from samples
- **O-glycosylation** is a ==major PTM== 
- Novel detection of **O-fucosylation** PTM in [[MMRN1 protein]], at the *N-terminal* on a [[Elastin Microfibril Interface (EMI)]] domain
- Domain is mostly likely ==substrate== for **POFUT1** or another platelet POFUT

**Unbiased detection of protein modifications including O-glycosylation of platelet releasates.** 
Histograms of the open-search analysis of high-dose thrombin stimulated platelet releasates showing the number of peptide spectral matches (PSMs) (y-axis) across all platelet samples identified as having a range of mass adducts (x-axis, each bar represents a 1 Th wide mass adduct bin). PSMs with a Byonic log probability (Log Prob) score >8 and had modifications to S,T,Y,K,R,D,E,N,Q,P,M,W were plotted. Modifications were plotted separately for common **low-mass modifications (_A_)** and **higher mass modifications (_B_)**. Delta masses corresponding to O-glycan masses are indicated by the glycan symbols. 
**C, quantitative O-glycomics analysis** of O-glycans detached by β-elimination from platelet releasate proteins as described in [Supplementary methods](https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(24)00007-0/fulltext#appsec1) (n = 5). Bond linkage types are indicated in the legend. The identified O-glycans are depicted as relative abundances out of all observed O-glycans (100%). 
**_D_, _boxplots_** showing quantitative analysis of thrombospondin-1 O-glycosylation at identified sites, (n = 5). W-Man is C-mannose modified tryptophan on the same peptide as the indicated Ser/Thr. 
**_E_, _boxplots_** showing quantitative analysis of latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1 O-glycosylation at identified sites, (n = 5). Hydroxy-N is hydroxylated asparagine on the same peptide as the indicated Ser/Thr. 
**F, boxplots** showing quantitative analysis of coagulation factor V O-glycosylation at identified sites, (n = 5).
