# Main Idea of Thesis
- Project helped ==characterise the proteome== of human platelet **lysate** and **releasate**, processed from samples
- **O-glycosylation** is a ==major PTM== 
- Novel detection of **O-fucosylation** PTM in [[MMRN1 protein]], at the *N-terminal* on a [[Elastin Microfibril Interface (EMI)]] domain
- Domain is mostly likely ==substrate== for **POFUT1** or another platelet POFUT
