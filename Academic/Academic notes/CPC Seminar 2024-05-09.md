# Professor Zhiyong Wang | Multimedia computing for multi-disciplinary collaboration 

**Date:** 9/5/24
**Seminar Series:** CPC Seminar Series
**Speaker(s):** Professor Zhiyong Wang

## What was the seminar about?
Sydney Informatics Hub director, Prof. Zhiyoung Wang
Focused on interdisciplinary multi-media content creation, computing in many areas including agriculture, data science etc.

> [!statement] Multimedia is the **foundation of human communication**

His work is divided into two categories:

| Multimedia Data Understanding   | Multimedia content creation        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Multi-modal video summarisation | Generative artificial intelligence |
| Audiovid analutics              | 3D construction/animation          |
| Human behaviour understanding   | VR/AR/MR                           |

Multimedia computing means ==working with Big Data== and using **AI** to build models based on experience through training.

Looking at unstructured data, through ==video analysis and summarisation==

## What were the major methods used?

Workflow as follows:
1. Input Video
2. Generate snippets (attention enhanced DD + Parameter sharing)
3. Extract features 
4. **Task-specific branches** (Classification+ regression)
5. Consensus layer (Classification and regression concessions)
6. Output (Parameters, Loss, data visualised and classified)

Also developed video summari
