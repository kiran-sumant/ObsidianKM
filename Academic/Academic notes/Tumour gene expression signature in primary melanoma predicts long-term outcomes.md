# Main Idea of Thesis

[[Adjuvant Systemic Therapy ]]used following [[resection]] of stage 3 [[melanoma]], but it requires more accurate [[prognostic]] data to classify/stratify patients.
Metastasis-associated gene signature identified, expression signature helps ID patients at high risk of metastasis.

# Details/Quotes

Use of [[Differential Expression Analysis]], on primary tumours from RNA-Sequenced Melanomas in an adjuvant trial.

Basically took RNA from tumour, sequences it

Used machine learning model to create the classification model. More accurate compared to:
- Clinical covariates
- Current basic prognostic signatures
