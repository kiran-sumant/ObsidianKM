# Main Idea of Thesis

[[Adjuvant Systemic Therapy ]]used following [[resection]] of stage 3 [[melanoma]], but it requires more accurate [[prognostic]] data to classify/stratify patients.
Metastasis-associated gene signature identified, expression signature helps ID patients at high risk of metastasis.

Prognostic biomarkers for cancers are vital but unmet in clinics. It will help guide adjuvant therapies. Clinical guidelines from trial study need to be established by further research, as most studies only undergo retrospective or pr

# Details/Quotes

Use of [[Differential Expression Analysis]], on primary tumours from RNA-Sequenced Melanomas in an adjuvant trial.

Basically took RNA from tumour, sequences it. We find Cam-121 gene expression the best indicator-most associated with (progression-free) melanoma survival

Used machine learning model to create the classification model. More accurate compared to:
- Clinical covariates
- Current basic prognostic signatures

Cam-121 Negatively correlates with TIL count.

## Machine Learning

R was used!!!
- Labelled for training
- One-Hot Encoding was used to convert covariate data to numeric dummy variables
- Variance StabilizingÂ Transformation (VST) used to transform both training and testing datasets for gene-expression data
- Data was used to train multiple ML models, and two-sample Welch t-tests used to statistically compare models based on AUROC (SVMRadical appears to be the most reliable across datasetsand classification models)
