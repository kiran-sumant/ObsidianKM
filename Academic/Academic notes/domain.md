A **stable sub-structure** of a protein with a ==specific, definite function== within the protein.


> [!important] 
> Domains fold and maintain their structure independent of the protein they are a part of, i.e ==they can exist as a structure if separated from the protein==

> [!warning] 
> NOT to be confused with [[motif]],  which is a smaller protein sequence that makes ==similar secondary structures== in multiple proteins. No comment on shared function, unlike with domains.
