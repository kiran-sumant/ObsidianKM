First recommended reading by Mark:
[[Ultra-sensitive platelet proteome maps the O-glycosylation landscape and charts the response to thrombin dosage]]
This one:
- tells me I gotta think more about my protein sequencing from 2021
- MS will be important, but Im probably working with more proteomics than metabolomics so less QQQ more simply MS/MS
- R processing will be long and arduous, but gyat dang it's gonna be cool to get the processed data onto Tableau
