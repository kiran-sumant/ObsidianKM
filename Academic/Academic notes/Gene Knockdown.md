shRNA and siRNA:

miRNA only bind to small seqs, only 2-7 nucleotides (nts) long.

siRNA usually coded into a vector

| *transduced*, and expressed in the nucleus                              | transfected directly into cell |
| inducible, controlled, or [[constitutive]]                              | long binding portion (~25 nt)  |
| Better for targeting ==essential genes== or proteins w/ long half-lives | may produce off-target effects |
