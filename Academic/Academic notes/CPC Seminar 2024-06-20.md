# turning up the heat on membrane lipid structure elucidation

**Date:** 20/6/24
**Seminar Series:** **2024 CPC Biology Domain Seminar Series**
**Speaker(s):** Professor Stephen Blanksby

## What was the seminar about?
Interest in structure of molecules in cellular structures.

FInctions of lipids:
- Cellular structures
- Inter/Inter-cellular comms
- Energy homeostasis

Emerging: **diversity of molecular structures** that carry out these functions.

Aim: being able to ==differentiate== between all 
difficulty:
genome doesnt predict lipid structure. so we need to rely almost entirely on LC/MS to elucidate lipid structures.

Proteome has interactions btwn glycome, lipidome, and proteome. these interactions are studied in ==metabolomics== 

Lipid Maps is most up to date structure database for lipids.
48000 lipid discoveries recorded on the site; milestone recently passed

Limited in MS to elucidate differences between isomers; there are so. many. isomers.

Lipid variability comes mainly from glycerophospholipids.
40 common fatty acids building blocks.

with ESI-MS gives m/z but lipids vaiability means like 16+ lipids for a single mass entry with very slight different m/z. **multiple isomeric components across lipids**

ESI-CID lipid isomer resolution: can still have same combo of fatty acids in a different structural configuration that gives the same fragments.

Also having different stereochemistry? bruh.

Activating C-C bonds to dissociation is the key to effective lipid structure elucidation. selective activation is what has to be researched.

## What were the major methods used?
ESI mass spec and ESI-CID-MS/MS
Bridge the gap: move from partial view to individual and explicit molecular structure.
***==Ozonolysis==***: attaches to double bonds, helps separate branches around a C=C. but how to figure out the original lipid?

Simnple: ***direct generation of ozone and feeding into the ion trap***. LTQ, can change the time in exposure of ionised lipids. ==10 seconds is the magic reaction time==!






## What did the speaker discover?

Ozone injection is a slow-low-tech experiment; ==***but it works***== : D
Shows multiple isomers with different double bond locations. Three separate isomers for a lipid in human ocular lens tissue.


# What question did you ask and what was the answer?
Electron Activated dissociation has demonstrated some effect in
