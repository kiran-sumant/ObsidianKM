# turning up the heat on membrane lipid structure elucidation

**Date:** 20/6/24
**Seminar Series:** **2024 CPC Biology Domain Seminar Series**
**Speaker(s):** Professor Stephen Blanksby

## What was the seminar about?
Interest in structure of molecules in cellular structures.

FInctions of lipids:
- Cellular structures
- Inter/Inter-cellular comms
- Energy homeostasis

Emerging: **diversity of molecular structures** that carry out these functions.

Aim: being able to ==differentiate== between all 
difficulty:
genome doesnt predict lipid structure. so we need to rely almost entirely on LC/MS to elucidate lipid structures.

Proteome has interactions btwn glycome, lipidome, and proteome. these interactions are studied in ==metabolomics== 

Lipid Maps is most up to date structure database for lipids.
48000 lipid discoveries recorded on the site; milestone recently passed

Limited in MS to elucidate differences between isomers; there are so. many. isomers.

Lipid variability comes mainly from glycerophospholipids.
40 common fatty acids building blocks.
