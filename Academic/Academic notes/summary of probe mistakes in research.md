# Chemical
- Incorrect Assay
- Improper preparation of biological system/in-vivo cells
- dependence on vendor catalogues
- dependence on a sole article that may have inherent/implicit bias
- Considers the limitation of probe suitability dependent on reaction and assay conditions
- suited and proven suited controls used


# Molecular
- error in nucleotide sequence (==affects binding affinity==)
- Identity error:
	- says **targeting** but *wrong target*: ==Irrelevant data==
	- says **non-targeting** but *is on-target*: ==Invalid negative ctrl==
	- says **targeting** but *is non-targeting*: ==Impossible data==
