==Polymerase Chain Reaction==

RNA/DNA amplification and quantitation

- Cycle of ==denaturation, primer annealing & primer extension== using a **heat-stable DNA polymerase**
- Separate forward and reverse PCR primers

Gene of interest compared to a "housekeeping gene" ==control==.

# RT-PCR

requires additional **reverse-transcription** step to synth cDNA from RNA
