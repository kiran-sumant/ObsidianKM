## Model use

Always attempt ==model diagnostics==; check the assumptions of what kind of regression you use.

Non-Normal continuous response variable is something to consider if we are using simple regression as this goes against assumptions.

Model selection: Have to select ==which explanatory variables== to include in the regression model.

Multicollinearity is possible between explan atory variables in multiple regression.

**Interaction term**: when one X variable modifies the effect of another X variable on Y.

# Generalised Linear Models

Incorporates the ==discrete/non-normal== distribution of a response variable.

**[[Logistic regression]]** - used for ==binary/dichotomous== data

**[[Multinomial regression]]** - for ==unordered, categorical== data

**[[Cumulative logistic regression]]** - for ==ordinal== data

**[[Poisson or Negative Binomial regression]]** - for ==count data==
