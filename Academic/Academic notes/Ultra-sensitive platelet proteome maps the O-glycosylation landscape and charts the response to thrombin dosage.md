# Main Idea of Thesis

O-glycosylation of platelet proteins at key functional/active sites has been discovered through High-Sensitivity proteome mapping.

Focus pt: - Platelet O-fucosyltransferase POFUT1 regulates the secretion of adhesive protein multimerin-1 (MMRN1)

# Details/Quotes
> Analysis of how the platelet proteome is altered in disease states such as type II diabetes, where platelets are known to be hyperactivated64 , should prove fruitful to detect new mechanisms of platelet dysfunction
