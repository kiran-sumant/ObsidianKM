# Main Idea of Thesis

O-glycosylation of platelet proteins at key functional/active sites has been discovered through High-Sensitivity proteome mapping.

Focus pt: - Platelet O-fucosyltransferase POFUT1 regulates the secretion of adhesive protein multimerin-1 (MMRN1)

AIM: **Provide insight into regulation and composition of healthy human platelets**, and set out a path for future studies in human platelet biology

# Details/Quotes

Applies:
- Proteomics
- Glycomics

Uses:
- LC-MS/MS
- Unbiased **open** PTM search 
- PGC-LC-MS/MS for O-glycome profiling 

Specifically looked at top-down proteomics for PTM search/ sequencing.

Analysed using R, plotted using Tableau

> Analysis of how the platelet proteome is altered in disease states such as type II diabetes, where platelets are known to be hyperactivated64 , should prove fruitful to detect new mechanisms of platelet dysfunction
