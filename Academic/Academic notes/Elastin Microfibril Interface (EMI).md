# Domain Definition

Sauce: [EMI, a novel cysteine-rich domain of EMILINs and other extracellular proteins, interacts with the gC1q domains and participates in multimerization](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11068053/)
> [!tip] 
> Seen in N-Terminus of EMILINs, the EMI domain is reported in proteins ==compatible== with **multimerin formation** 
> > [!attention]- Note
> > *Not all have been proven to form multimers, it is just shown that they ==theoretically== can*

Fig. 1. Two novel O-fucose sites were identified on the EMI domain of MMRN1. 
**a.** Domain organization of human MMRN1 protein. The positions of O-linked fucosylation and N-glycan sequons are shown as red triangles and green branches, respectively. Protein domains are illustrated: yellow – RGD motif (cell attachment site); blue – EMI domain; green – coiled-coil region; red – EGF-like domain; orange – C1q domain. Black arrows indicate the expression constructs used in this study. 
==**b.** AlphaFold2 structure== of the ==EMI domain from human MMRN1 protein== coloured by with a rainbow style from the N-terminal side (blue) to the C-terminal side (red). Disulphide bonds are shown and the O-fucosylated residues are labelled. 
**c.** Cartoon of the homotrimer MMRN1 structure with key domains shown. Clustal Omega alignment of all human EMI domain protein sequences colored by residue type. Subgroups with high similarity are bound by black boxes. The O-fucosylated residues in MMRN1 are labelled. 
**d.** HCD-MS/MS spectra of fucosylated peptides 209NWCAYVHTR217 and 263IVTSLDWR270 that contain the ==novel T216 and T265 O-fucose sites== (*highly conserved*) in MMRN1 EMI domains. Extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of different glycoforms were inserted for each peptide: red lines, O-fucose modified; black lines, unmodified. The EIC and spectra for T1055 O-fucose modification in MMRN1 EGF domain are in Data S1. [[FUT10 and FUT11 are novel protein O-fucosyltransferases that modify protein EMI domains|Sauce]]
