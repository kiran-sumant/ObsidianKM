## Clarify:
- Weighted Cam-121 score - > For each sample, a ==vector== of [[weighted signature expression score]]s was calculated by using Eq. 1 on the vst normalised gene expression data ([[Tumour gene expression signature in primary melanoma predicts long-term outcomes.pdf#page=11&selection=412,2,413,80|link]])
Eq.1: $$ Weighted \ signature \ score =  \sum_ {i=1}^nÎ²_i  \times gene_i  $$
- TIL count; Clark Score vs MIA

| ~~Compare Fig2.A with Fig2.F, test values/data to see if curves are statistically similar~~                      |
| What are the downregulated key immune-mediated processes in the samples from patients that developed metastases? |

<u>***What link can be made between metastases and OS/PFS, or TIL count?***<u>

We can work with processed rows as n=143 for AVAST-M LN

data sources:

1. Table 1 for survivability (??????????????????)
2. Fig. 3b_3c_3d for metastases analyses (143 rows per analysis model)

PFS and OS for Fig.2 are both calculated from same dataset
