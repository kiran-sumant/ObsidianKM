## Clarify:
- Weighted Cam-121 score - > For each sample, a ==vector== of weighted signature expression scores was calculated by using Eq. 1 on the vst normalised gene expression data ([[Tumour gene expression signature in primary melanoma predicts long-term outcomes.pdf#page=11&selection=412,2,413,80|link]])
Eq.1: $$ Weighted signature score =  ¼ Xn i¼1 βi ´ gene  $$
