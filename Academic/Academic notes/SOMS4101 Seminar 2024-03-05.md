# Chemical Probes vs Molecular Probes

| Molecular                                                            | Chemical                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suppress expression of protein via [[RNA Interference (RNAi)\|RNAi]] | Selective *small molecule modulators*                          |
| Irreversible                                                         | Reversible Effects                                             |
| Commonly removes/supresses whole protein                             | probes function of protein in; dose- and time-dependent manner |
| Interactome around protein + protein itself                          | controls the extent + kinetics of targeted protein modulation  |

## Chem Probes
Purgeturbs prot function.

once a molecule is on the portal it is generally trusted,
dependent upon chemical matter criteria:
- no [PAINS](Pan-Assay INterference CompoundS (Pains)) element
- Available; *inactive control*
- Solubility
- Stability

and target-related criteria:Z
- Biochemical potency
- cellular potency
- selectivity
- target engagement

Probe's fundamental fitness factors (*must be adhered to*):
- in vitro potency < 100 nM
- >30-fold selectivity against other subfamilies
- on-target cellular activity < 1 uM

***Probes aren't drugs***

drug **multi-targets**
some drugs become probes if selective enough and vice versa (if multi selective)

however, little thought on drug-selectivity during development, mainly trying to manage side effects from a plethora of IP issues/risk management.

DO NOT TRUST THE CORPOS WHEN SELECTING APPROPRIATE PROBES

trust scientist-driven websites and portals:
- ==Chem Probes Portal==
- Donated Chem probes
- Gray Lab Probes
- NIH Molecular Libraries program
- Structural Genomics Consortium Chemical Probes

Score systems for [Chemical Probes Portal](http://www.chemicalprobes.org/):
uses 4 star system to recommend.
also has historic compounds:

## Historic Compounds
- over 200 compounds never to be used, ever.

# Inactive/Orthogonal Control Compounds

- Inactive is highly structurally similar, way less active than probe

- Orthogonal is structurally distinct compound but also inhibits protein of interest.
allowa to differ between **on-target** and **off-target effects**

off-target effect (lookout for):

- Inactive probe and Probe have the ==same observed phenotype==, same effect

- Orthogonal Probe and Probe have ==different phenotype/ effect not observed in Probe 2==

[[Half-Maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC50)]]
IC50 needs to be less than 100nM,  means ==less of compound== has ==more potency.==


## [[PROTACs]]

Targeted protein degradation done with ==molecular glues== and **PRO**teolytic **TA**rgeting **C**himeras (PROTACs)

Molecular glue - binds Protein of interest and **E3 ligase**
