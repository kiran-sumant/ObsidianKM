# Chemical Probes vs Molecular Probes

| Molecular                                                            | Chemical Probes                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suppress expression of protein via [[RNA Interference (RNAi)\|RNAi]] | Selective *small molecule modulators*                          |
| Irreversible                                                         | Reversible Effects                                             |
| Commonly removes/supresses whole protein                             | probes function of protein in; dose- and time-dependent manner |

## Chem Probes
Purgeturbs prot function.

once a molecule is on the portal it is generally trusted,
dependent upon chemical matter criteria:
- no PAINS element
- Available; *inactive control*
- Solubility
- Stability

and target-related criteria:Z
- Biochemical potency
- cellular potency
- selectivity
- target engagement

Probe's fundamental fitness factors (*must be adhered to*):
- in vitro potency < 100 nM
- >30-fold selectivity against other subfamilies
- on-target cellular activity < 1 uM

***Probes aren't drugs***

drug **multi-targets**
some drugs become probes if selective enough and vice versa (if multi selective)

however, little thought on drug-selectivity during development, mainly trying to manage side effects from a plethora of IP issues/risk management.

DO NOT TRUST THE CORPOS WHEN SELECTING APPROPRIATE PROBES
