# Principles of data visualisation

- We gotta start simple then go more complicated. start with a table, then go higher.

- Data should **stand out**. All other elements play wingman to data in order to make it *pop*.

- Look at colour, avoid clutter, learn to prioritise without prioritising too much

- Spa    ce cre    ate   s grou    ps. Use this to your advantage, and be aware of it's effect

- Group by:
	- Colour
	- Spacing
- Learn how to group different plots through colours for easy visual comparison

- Avoid using colour on elements that aren't data, ==draws attention to something important==, or use to support the data's/your message.

- Avoid colour/colour with visual pull, in:
	- Background
	- Data labels
	- Data annotations
	- Low priority data

- Consider *Horizontal bar graphs* ~~wow how the fuck did i actually not think of this bruhhhhh~~

- Rearrange data vis and denote legend to allow for comparisons to be made where needed, as much as possible. Learn to answer questions more effectively by isolating categories, and breaking out relevant groups.
