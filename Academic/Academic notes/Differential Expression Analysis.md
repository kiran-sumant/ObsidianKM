Used to evaluate genes that are expressed throughout conditions/processes, at different levels.

use case: helps give insight into processed affected by conditions being researched.

# Steps

1. Data collection (*RNA-sequencing, microarray*)
2. Data Processing (*quality control, normalisation*)
3. Differential Gene Expression Testing (*statistical analysis of genes identified to be differentially expressed between groups*)
4. Functional analyses of discovery set (*downstream analysis of validation, functional testing*)
