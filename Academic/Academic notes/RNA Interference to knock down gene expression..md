# Main Idea of Thesis

[[RNA Interference (RNAi)]]
- multi-step process
- Been used to study gene's cellular functions

Advice: due to different knockdown efficiencies of genes, it's important to use multiple siRNA sequences for each gene, to be optimised.

Negative control siRNA - no known homology to target genome.

delivery can be done **either** through *transfection* or *electroporation*
