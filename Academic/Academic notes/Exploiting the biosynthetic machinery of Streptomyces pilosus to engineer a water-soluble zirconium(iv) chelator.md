#### [Doc Link](Exploiting%20the%20biosynthetic%20machinery%20of%20Streptomyces%20pilosus%20to%20engineer%20a%20water-soluble%20zirconium(iv)%20chelator.pdf)

# Details/Quotes

Pipeline:
Bacterial supernatant -> centrifugation -> XAD resin to retain **all organic compounds** (no salt binding) -> IMAC resin to retain ==target metal chelating compounds== -> HPLC to separate based on polarity -> MS-QQQ Identifies m/z value for each analyte; fragments selected analytes for fragmentation pattern.
