# Main Idea of Thesis

Substance that can bind to Zr(IV)-89 by improving its ability to dissolve in water, using a mix of microbiology and chemistry to change an analogue. 

First, modified version of a natural substance called desferrioxamine B (DFOB) by growing bacteria with a chemical called ==oxybis(ethanamine)==. 

New version, (DFOB-O3), was much more soluble in water than the original. 

Subsequentially combined DFOB-O3 with another chemical to make it even more soluble, creating a new substance called DFOB-O3â€“PBH-O1.

Implications: could be useful for making drugs and imaging agents for PET scans.

# Details/Quotes

Pipeline:
Bacterial supernatant -> centrifugation -> XAD resin to retain **all organic compounds** (no salt binding) -> IMAC resin to retain ==target metal chelating compounds== -> HPLC to separate based on polarity -> MS-QQQ Identifies m/z value for each analyte; fragments selected analytes for fragmentation pattern.
