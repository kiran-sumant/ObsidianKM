# **Worksheet for the Chemical Probes Computer lab**

During this practical, collate information about chemical probes needed for experiments investigating a protein of interest (_i.e.,_ target) that you have been assigned. Address as many queries in this worksheet as possible. The information you collate here will form basis of your report for the **_Molecular and Chemical Probes in Biomedical Research_** module. If you know the aims of your Honours projects and it includes investigating/validating a function of a given protein, you might work on chemical probes targeting the protein of interest (if probes exists).

**Protein of interest (target):** F2R from GCPR family

**Target protein name (synonyms):** Proteinase-activated receptor 1, TR, PAR1, CF2R, F2R, PAR1_HUMAN, PAR-1, Thrombin receptor, Coagulation factor II receptor

**Target protein function:** F2R is a thrombin receptor expressed on human platelets and endothelial cells, and aids in maintaining vascular wall stability. It is also a key modulator of endothelial lining as part of the cascade process

**Target protein mechanism of action:** 
The n-terminus of F2R serves as a substrate for multiple proteases upstream in the clotting process (e.g: _serine protease_ cathepsin G). Cleavage of the F2R N-terminus exposes an attached ligand group that activates the receptor. Ligation of this exposed binding site stimulates a series of phosphorylation events and intracellular signalling.

name at least three downstream substrates/protein regulated by the targeted protein
Beta-arrestin (regulates β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK)),
PLCε Phospholipase C epsilon (activation triggers Caspase 3, a "death protease")
NR2A and NMDA (Calcium ion channel, triggers block, apoptosis)
