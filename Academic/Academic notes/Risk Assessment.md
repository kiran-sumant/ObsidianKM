Carried out when:
- Work activity is made/ proposed
- Work activity has changed; new hazards, etc

Risk assessment is **mandatory** for reassessment every 5 years. This is done because ==processes update, and so does out awareness of hazards for certain things.==

Incidents may also result in reassessment, such as when ***hazards interact***, because overall risk changes.

Risks can be evaluated based on the **Risk Matrix**
