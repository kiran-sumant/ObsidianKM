Consideration for type of study to use:


| Risk-Factor\\Outcome | Poor | Good | Total |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Yes                  | A    | B    | A+B   |
| No                   | C    | D    | C+D   |
| Total                | A+C  | B+D  | ABCD  |

Cross-sectional study: 
==A+B+C+D==

Cohort Study/Clinical Trial:
==A+B vs C+D==

Case-Control Study:
==A+C vs B+D==, uses Odds Ratio

# Work Health and Safety Topic
Carried out when:
- Work activity is made/ proposed
- Work activity has changed; new hazards, etc

Risk assessment is **mandatory** for reassessment every 5 years. This is done because ==processes update, and so does out awareness of hazards for certain things.==

Incidents may also result in reassessment, such as when ***hazards interact***, because overall risk changes.

Risks can be evaluated based on the **Risk Matrix**

## Safe-Work Procedure (SWP)

Once RA has been created/amended, needs to be sent to Work Safety Officer.

Stuff to consider for SWP:
- Materials SDS
- Methods
- Risk Assessment review date, reference number, proposal date
- People creating the protocol
- People engaging in the experiment
- Waste disposal
