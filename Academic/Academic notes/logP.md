Partition Coefficient-

Indicator of whether ==compound== is more *soluble in aqueous or organic solvent*.

# LogP/LogD

- **Very Hydrophilic**: ~ -5 to -10
- **Hydrophilic**: ~ -4 to 3
- **Lipophilic**: ~ 4 to 10

Normal Phase LC **4 to 10**
Reverse Phase LC **0 to 6**
Polar-Modified LC **-2 to 6**
HILIC **-7 to 3**
Ion Exchange **-10 to 0**
Capillary Electrophoresis **-10 to 0**
Supercritical Fluid Chromatography **Full range**

***IMPORTANT:***

-10 to -5 : ==Antibiotics, polysaccharides, polyamines, amino acids==

-5 to 0 : ==Metabolites, neurotransmitters, amino acids/peptides, nucleo(t/s)ides==

0 to 5 : ==Most ordinary drugs==

5 to 10 : ==Lipids, liposoluble vitamins, some plant components==


**SFC not the best as it's sensitivity is crap. always use the sensitive method in the range of a target analyte**
