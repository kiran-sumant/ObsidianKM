# Multimerin 1 protein

Platelet Protein

Major Alpha granule protein

Supports **platelet adhesion to collagen**, among adhesion of many other cell types

Found to contain the [[Elastin Microfibril Interface (EMI)]] domain, and is part of the [[EMILIN]] protein family

Contributes in the clotting process.

==Hypothesised== according to [[Analysis of the Healthy Platelet Proteome Identifies a New Form of Domain-Specific O-Fucosylation|Houlahan et al, 2024]], to form **elongated multimers** in order to bind platelets to collagen and create clots.

Sauce: [Multimerin 1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09537100701832157)
