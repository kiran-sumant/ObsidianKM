# Main Idea of Thesis

MIQE: Minimum Info for Publication of Quantitative real-time qPCR experiements

- Created because lack of sufficient experimental detail in current literature. 
- Published as an abbreviated form or online supplement
- helps peer-reviews assess validity

note, the above is not all, it's just all I could include.

- Some terms are both standardised and bastardisation of method and scientific names is prevented

**Repeatability**: precision and robustness of assay with identical samples. *SD for Cq variance*

**Reproducibility**:  Variation in results btwn runs/ btwn diffferent laboratories. *SD / CV of concentrations or copy no's*
