# Research Essentials: Analysing your data

Sydney informatics hub (SIH) is a core facility, includes the Artemis HPC (supercomputer)

## Workflow

 SIH has a general research workflow for completing analysis.

1. Hypothesis generation
2. Experimental, analytical design
3. Collect Data
4. Clean Data
5. Exploratory data analysis
6. Data analysis or inferential analysis
7. Predictive modelling
8. Publication

## Statistical Inference

It is the **theory, methods, and practice** of forming ==judgements== about **population features** based on random sampling.

This allows for **Predictive modelling, which can be done two ways:

| Inferential Predictive statistics   | Machine Learning/Predictive Analytics |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Used in more environmental settings | Used in more corporate settings       |

| Graphical User Interface                      | Command Line Interface                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GUI                                           | CLI                                                                  |
| Interactive, point-and-click                  | Less interactive, more bare-bones                                    |
| Easier to get started                         | For those more technically versed                                    |
| Less reproducability                          | Much more reproducible                                               |
| Might be less intricate understanding of data | Requires and provides deeper understanding of the data you work with |


> [!warning] Note
> Avoid using spreadsheets for data entry. Use something that makes sure you make **less mistakes**.

## Tidy data
Defined by three things:
1. One category per column
2. One item per row
3. One value per cell


> [!summary] for da books
> Keep in mind where you can **transform** your data from wide to narrow, avoids common visualisation pitfalls, and **increases data versatility**.
