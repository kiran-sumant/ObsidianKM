# Statistical Concepts 101

A measurement is:
- One-dimensional
- Linear
- Abstract
- Independent of measurement subjects
- Independent of measurement instrument

levels of measurement 

| Nature      | Level              | Action/Operations | E.g.                   |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Categorical | Nominal            | None              | Sex, Language          |
|             | Ordinal            | Order             | Rank, Disease severity |
| Numerical   | Interval/ Discrete | +,-               | Parity, ℃              |
|             | Ratio/ Continuous  | +,-,÷,×           | Weight / Height        |

## Sample vs Population

Representation sample of a population; statistical results will be **inference**.
Sampling bias is ==present==.

Sampling strategies to reduce bias include:
- Simple random sampling

- Systematic sampling (sampling where random sampling isn't completely possible, done through system of regularly spaced samples in an order)

- Stratified random sampling (groups not equally represented, select randomly *according to relative size* in comparison to population)

- Cluster sampling (*large population*, randomly select clusters and select sample within cluster. Hopefully not introducing bias)

- Non-random/ *purposive sampling* (if target population too small, or looking for a specific conditions to obtain hypothesized results through conditional outcome)

## Summarising Data

- Frequency tables
==Number of intervals × interval width==
- Relative frequencies
==Probabilities or percentages==

## Case Study

[[A Validated Smartphone-Based Assessment of Gait and Gait Variability in Parkinson’s Disease]]
