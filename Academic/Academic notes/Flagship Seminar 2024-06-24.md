# How killer T cells sniff out the viruses hiding in your cells

**Date:** 24/06/24
**Seminar Series:** **SOMS Flagship Seminar Series**
**Speaker(s):** Prof David Tscharke (NHMRC Leadership Fellow in the John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University).

## What was the seminar about?
Based man talking about vaccinia virus.
wants to identify how human genes and proteins are up/downregulated in the prescence of viral proteins.

Specific study targets monkeypox virus. we care about it because it had an outbreak in aus, not because of the raging epidemic in East africa killing tens of thousands of people.
## What were the major methods used?
Quantifying viral [[epitope]]s:
Lyse and purify virus infection, absolute quantification, fractionation with RP-HPLC then coutpled RP-HPLC-QQQ-MS. this is done in multiple cell lines and compared.
Presentation DOES differ between cell types.
on a single epitope level, does presentation differ between cell types? well yes but actually no.
all cell lines generally present well/equally.
do all cells become a bag of virus/virus factor/ specialise into virus factor? NO, they maintain their own cell identity, just being hijacked not convertedviral proteome presents similarly within cells, with primary bone marrow expresses viral proteome least while it has the most intense cell response to infection. (makes sense, it is bone marrow.)
Slowest at processing viral peptides from proteins is fibroblasts.
everything from translation to presentation of viral proteins is a black box. also it happens superfast, implying assays are problematic to create.
abundant proteins do not appear to produce more epitopes -> implied viral prot production in parallel with translation.

**Immunogenicity:** infect mouse, after seven days coculture
Presentation in-vitro levels do not predict immunogenicity.
In-vitro design: is it a sensible experiment for modelling immunogenicity.
Mouse hyperinfection: 24h take spleen sample, then MRM MS
same thing with : 7d take spleen sample, then ICS
- changed the infection route.
- measuring abundance of epitopes in vivo.
## What did the speaker discover?
Matching presentation with T-cells
presentation levels **==in-vivo==** predicts immunogenicity!
something drives correlation significance with in-vivo and the specific cell types.

are all viruses the same?
what happens if dendritic cells aren't infected by a particular virus?
***cross presentation*** helps in dendritic cells, but if non canonical and canonical mechanisms of presentation are different, brings in more implications for viral infection.

Antibody production is wasteful; large number are ineffective; what if it's the same for T-cells?

we find that number of peptides with related immunogenicity **differ btwn HSV and Vaccinia**.

Now we want to push towards human t cell response and human viral infection as opposed to in vivo and mice.


# What question did you ask and what was the answer?

Could you please clarify what are the current limitations of MS technology that need to be addressed for more effective investigation?
