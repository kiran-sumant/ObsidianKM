A **statistical measurement** to ==validate a hypothesis==, calculates the ==probability== based on data parameters and assumptions, **how likely** it is to get the "==alternative hypothesis data=="/"data is significantly different from population mean", if ==**no real difference existed==/ null hypothesis is true.**

> Essentially the p-value measures how **likely** it is to obtain the data tested, ==if== the **null hypothesis is true**. ==[[q-value]] measures the opposite==
