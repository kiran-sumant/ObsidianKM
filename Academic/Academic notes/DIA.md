Data Independent Acquisition

not to be confused with [[DDA]]

- Almost ***ALL fragments*** are fragmented together and ==subsequently analysed==
- Employs a **spectral library** for data extraction and quantification
- High precision, high **quantitative accuracy**
- Workflow as follows:
	1. Peptides from LC all selected as relased from chromatogram
	2. All peptides fragmented in order of LC release
	3. Data obtained and proteins identified and quantified.
