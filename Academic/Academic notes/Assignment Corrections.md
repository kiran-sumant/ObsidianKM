# Research Showcase
## Detailed Marking
> [!NOTE]-  From Examiner 1:Â **Rebecca Poulos**
> This Showcase is very well written. Kiran has done an excellent job of explaining a highly complex research topic and the proposed analyses. The work provides detailed information relating to the relevant background and associated experimental techniques. 
> 
> MAJOR COMMENTS 
> 1. The rationale for the hypotheses should be strengthened as it is unclear from the background provided why the researchers hold these specific hypotheses. 
> 2. Aim 2 presupposes a particular outcome from Aim 1, which is not well supported in the text. What direction would the researchers take if their hypothesis is not supported in Aim 1? 
> 3. There are several errors in the References. E.g., reference 41 is missing volume and issue number; some journals have excessively long names, others are abbreviated, etc. 
> 
> MINOR COMMENTS 
> 1. There is inconsistency in the use of the PTM abbreviation. It is not defined at first mention, and later is defined twice. 
> 2. It is customary to provide the full abbreviation for terms used in a figure within the associated figure legend. This aids interpretation of the figure. 
> 3. Typographical error in the last paragraph of 3.2.2. 
> 4. It is not necessary to quote directly from a reference (see first paragraph of 3.2.1). A paraphrase is more customary.

> - The first page was hard to follow given a lot of assumed knowledge was expected. Acronyms were used but not expanded on first use. It was also not so clear what fucosylation was, in particular, its mode of activity. 
> - Given the above, while the aims were clear, what was not clear is how they related or how each different hypothesis was formulated. 
> - There was no indication by this first page that FUT10 acts any different to FUT11 on MFAP2. There was also no indication that the absence of 0-fucose impacts MFAP2 binding to fibrillin-1. 
> - In short, it was not until the Background that followed that this all made some sense. Also, proteins are better known to be translated and not expressed. 
> - The background was clear, and all acronyms were now defined, along with fucosylation that was lacking from first page. Similarly, the Research Plan was well written and covered. Phrases like 'we are proficient in' instilled some confidence in execution unless this was simply taken from lab heads grant application. 
> - Some sentences started with lower case, which was careless, and some statements missed linker words (e.g. the Outcomes on the last Page: "We MFAP2 to have aâ€¦..". Good use of diagrams to support methods. Presentation was overall very good. References appeared accurate but some had UPPER case text and others missed important details, substituting XXXX for Volume and Page numbers. Another oversight that was missed on review.

## Takeaways
- Spend more word count on **articulating** the ==basis for hypothesis==
- ==An aim should not be dependent on a previous aim's results==; otherwise provide an alternative approach if pursuing a dependent aim.
- Linker words; **==read aloud the bloody thing before submission.==**
- ==gene== = **expressed**, ==protein== = **translated**.
- **Clearly distinguish** between **similar elements** like ==FUT10 and FUT11==; explain their *specific roles and impacts*.
- If little is known about the action of two similar elements like ==FUT10 and FUT11==, **explain why little is known;** ==research gap.==
