From liquid chromatography

to Ion source.

Analytes get charged via Ion source,

into **inlet**, containing ==mass analyser== and ==detector== in vacuum system

**Mass analyser**- separates analytes by M/Z or *mass to charge ratio* 

detector determines *abundance* of each compound present sorted by m/z, **resulting in a spectrum**.
