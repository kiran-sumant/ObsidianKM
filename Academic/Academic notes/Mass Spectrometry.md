From liquid chromatography

to Ion source.

Analytes get charged via Ion source,

into **inlet**, containing ==mass analyser== and ==detector== in vacuum system

**Mass analyser**- separates analytes by M/Z or *mass to charge ratio* 

detector determines *abundance* of each compound present sorted by m/z, **resulting in a spectrum**.


## Analysis MS Machines:

- SQ - simple chem reactions/sysnthesis
- QQQ - Drug metabolites
- QTRAP, QTOF - protein analyses, using advanced MS systems


> [!example]
> We'll be using QTrap/Orbitrap for the rest of our experiments
