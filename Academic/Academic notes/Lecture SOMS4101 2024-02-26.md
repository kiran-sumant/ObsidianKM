# Mass Spectrometry & HPLC

Our data analysis will include from SQ, QQQ, and Orbitrap instruments (MS)

Need to use GraphPad ==Prism== for final report.

***OMICS FOR THE WINNN***

Exponential increase in publication of multi-omics research.

We're learning how to process, up to use to create our pipelines and innovate out research questions with MS.

Separation of analytes is the main step in the pipeline that risks altering the analyte of interest if we are not careful.

Analysing from chemical synthesis is easy and straightforward.
*Biological samples tho...* hmmmmmmmmm

Pipeline: [[Pipeline of Sample prep-extraction.excalidraw]]

# Liquid Chromatography

Principles **same as all chromatography**
Analytes have two interactions:
	1. Stationary phase
	2. Mobile phase

- Stronger interaction determines which analytes are drawn in, and how fast.

 Types of LC:
 - Size exclusion Chromatography
 - [[Polarity based Chromatography]]
 - Affinity Chromatography


Looking for platforms

Gotta look at ==log P / Log D== values for the target analyte, determines hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.

Phase interaction will thus be affected by pH. ***Setting pH important!***

| Structure | Chemical    | Interaction on Sationary Phase |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
|           | NaCl        | retained                               |
|           | Hexane      | not retained                               |
|           | Lipids      | not retained                               |
|           | Amino Acids | retained                               |
|           | 6-APA       | retained- pH dependent due to functional group                               |
|           | 7-APA            | retained- pH dependent due to functional group                               |

| Structure | Chemical | Interaction on Sationary Phase |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  | NaCl | not retained |
|   | Hexane | retained |
|  | Lipids | retained |
|  | Amino Acids | not retained |
|  | 6-APA | retained |
|  | 7-APA | retained |

- Added functional groups on C8 can affect/specify analyte interaction, changing retention and methods for extraction.

Particle size in resin beads affects retention rate. Usually use 3 um, but find right column for right experiment.


## Looking for mobile phases for LC
- Aqueous
- Organic
- Modifiers (==needs be MS compatible==)

isocratic -  *Constant flow of single mobile phase* 
gradient - Start with wak eluent, increase concentration %-wise.

Above methods + mediums used well help ***shorten runtime*** and increase efficiency/optimisation of elution.

***Instrumental setup can effect flow rate.***
Consider:
- Gravity/capillary effects
- using a pump is preferred


# Mass Spectrometry

Objectives?
- Chemical analysis
- Compounds from biological systems:
	- Metabolic regulation
	- Metabolic Changes in pathogenesis
	- Drug metabolites
- Finding suitable instruments is more important than using the "best performing one".
