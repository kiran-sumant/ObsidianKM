# Mass Spectrometry & HPLC

Our data analysis will include from SQ, QQQ, and Orbitrap instruments (MS)

Need to use GraphPad ==Prism== for final report.

***OMICS FOR THE WINNN***

Exponential increase in publication of multi-omics research.

We're learning how to process, up to use to create our pipelines and innovate out research questions with MS.

Separation of analytes is the main step in the pipeline that risks altering the analyte of interest if we are not careful.

Analysing from chemical synthesis is easy and straightforward.
*Biological samples tho...* hmmmmmmmmm
