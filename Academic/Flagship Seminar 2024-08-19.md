# Title: RNA in Neuroscience

**Date:** 19/08/2024
**Seminar Series:** Flagship Seminar Series
**Speaker(s):** Prof Timothy Brady

## What was the seminar about?

RNA medicine is the new frontier in drug development; co-opting body's machinery to generate therapy in-cell.
- Little work has been done in brain.
- Many disorders that are neurodegenerative associated with RNA dysregulation/==toxic RNAs,== such as Huntington's disease.
- Autism been associated with ==RNA editing==??
**neurological disorders characterised by initial onset of cognitive degeneration**

## **[[small non-coding RNAs]]**
miRNA seen to modulate neuroplasticity
==critically involved== in ==memory formation==!!

you can rescue learning impairments through miRNA; shows they are targets for treating brain disorders!! **seen in mice**

## **[[Long noncoding RNAs]]** 
Found to play ==fundamental role== in ==gene regulation and **cellular metabolism**==.
1. Control devices
2. Scaffolds
3. Guides

we target **Gomafu**, which is shown to have multiple splicing functions depending on splicing pattern and extra-environmental conditions.



## What were the major methods used?

Molecular dissection of **Pavlovian fear conditioning**
Also of **Extinction of Conditioned Fear**; key component of ==exposure therapy==.

RNA CaptureSeq allows for extraction of targeted RNA, increases sensitivity for targeted RNA that are low expression.

**ADRAM** is involved in extinction memory. driven through direct interaction with a chaperone protein.

Cool facts: RNA CaptureSeq shows stress can result in transgenerational traits through RNA cell signalling.

Research question: is lncRNA presenr in the synapse?
answer: YES, abundantly expressed in the synaptic compartment. 

Fear conditioned animals show that with extinction learning, expression of certain lncRNA Gas5 is upregulated after EXT, heavily involved in stress response.

## What did the speaker discover?


# What question did you ask and what was the answer?
Do you/have you seen any advancements in RNA therapeutics for Parkinsons, considering it's also a neurodegenerative disease?
