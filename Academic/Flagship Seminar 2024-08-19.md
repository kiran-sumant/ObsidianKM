# Title: RNA in Neuroscience

**Date:** 19/08/2024
**Seminar Series:** Flagship Seminar Series
**Speaker(s):** Prof Timothy Brady

## What was the seminar about?

RNA medicine is the new frontier in drug development; co-opting body's machinery to generate therapy in-cell.
- Little work has been done in brain.
- Many disorders that are neurodegenerative associated with RNA dysregulation/==toxic RNAs,== such as Huntington's disease.
- Autism been associated with ==RNA editing==??
**neurological disorders characterised by initial onset of cognitive degeneration**

## **[[small non-coding RNAs]]**
miRNA seen to modulate neuroplasticity
==critically involved== in ==memory formation==!!

you can rescue learning impairments through miRNA; shows they are targets for treating brain disorders!! **seen in mice**

## **[[Long noncoding RNAs]]** 
Found to play ==fundamental role== in ==gene regulation and **cellular metabolism**==.
1. Control devices
2. Scaffolds
3. Guides

we target **Gomafu**, which is shown to have multiple splicing functions depending on splicing pattern and extra-environmental conditions.



## What were the major methods used?

Molecular dissection of **Pavlovian fear conditioning**
Also of **Extinction of Conditioned Fear**; key component of ==exposure therapy==.

RNA CaptureSeq allows for extraction of targeted RNA, increases sensitivity for targeted RNA that are low expression.

**ADRAM** is involved in extinction memory. driven through direct interaction with a chaperone protein.

Cool facts: RNA CaptureSeq shows stress can result in transgenerational traits through RNA cell signalling.

Research question: is lncRNA presenr in the synapse?
answer: YES, abundantly expressed in the synaptic compartment. 

## What did the speaker discover?

Fear conditioned animals show that with extinction learning, expression of certain lncRNA Gas5 is upregulated after EXT, heavily involved in stress response.

Gas5 shown to bind to many synapse proteins, many of which are associated with RNA granule formation

**CIRTS - CRISPR- inspired RNA targeting system** tool to manipulate RNA in a manner that is:
1. ==cell specific==
2. ==synapse-specific==
3. ==state-dependent==

mechanism proof of concept confirmed.

Gas5- CIRTS knockdown leads to dysregulation of proper protein recruitment, thus affecting inherent function in the synapse.

# What question did you ask and what was the answer?
Do you/have you seen any advancements in RNA therapeutics for Parkinsons, considering it's also a neurodegenerative disease?

There is! some lncRNA have been identified to play a role/mark an indicative signal of parkinsons in

What quality control pathway is being used for the thing you talked about "fixing parts of the protein"?

It hasn't been confirmed exactly what kind of pathway might exist, but in a similar manner to which chaperones are recruited to dysfunctional proteins in the cell, many enzymes have been seen clustered around cellular sites where proteins underwent "local correction". 

Understanding the ways in which "multi-exonic micropeptides" are both regulated and expressed/localised will help give a better understanding of how such mechanisms function and dysfunction.

## General comments:

[[Circular RNA]] therapies have potential for long-term therapies.
