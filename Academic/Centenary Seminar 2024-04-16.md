# Advax-CpG55.2™ Adjuvant and Immunisation of Newborns

**Date:** 16/404/2024
**Seminar Series:** **Centenary Institute Research Seminar Series** 

**Speaker(s):** Dr. Isaac G. Sakala  (Senior Research Officer within the Tuberculosis Research Program: Advancing Vaccine Adjuvant Research for Tuberculosis project).

## What was the seminar about?
Immunisation of newborns against influenza


## What were the major methods used?
use of binding assays
Stem model for immunisation
use of rat model for monitoring toxicity and testing antibody prevalence

SARS-CoV-2:
DART study was used for developmental study. pregnant mice immunised with spike protein Clinical observations were recorded and immunogenicity of both mothers and offspring were analysed.

## What did the speaker discover?
Discovered Advax-CpG55.2 doesn't activate the NF-kB signalling pathway in vitro.

Adjuvanted Flu vaccination may be the key to developing vaccines for newborns 

SARS-CoV-2:
Vaccine was safe in pregnant mothers (according to animal model)

The female mice were also immunised during pregnancy
