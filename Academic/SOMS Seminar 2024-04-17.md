# Research Essentials: Analysing your data

Sydney informatics hub (SIH) is a core facility, includes the Artemis HPC (supercomputer)

## Workflow

 SIH has a general research workflow for completing analysis.

1. Hypothesis generation
2. Experimental, analytical design
3. Collect Data
4. Clean Data
5. Exploratory data analysis
6. Data analysis or inferential analysis
7. Predictive modelling
8. Publication

## Statistical Inference

It is the **theory, methods, and practice** of forming ==judgements== about **population features** based on random sampling.

This allows for **Predictive modelling, which can be done two ways:

| Inferential Predictive statistics   | Machine Learning/Predictive Analytics |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Used in more environmental settings | Used in more corporate settings       |
