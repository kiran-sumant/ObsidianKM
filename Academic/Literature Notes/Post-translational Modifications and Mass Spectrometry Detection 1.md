# Main Idea of Thesis

Another Lit review BRUHH

- Principles of mass spec and **peptide enrichment strategies**
- Analysed all PTM data in UniProt as of 2013
- Analysed evolution of data
- in depth analysis for articles 2010-2012 reporting PTM detection via MS.

# Details/Quotes

> [!statement] The History
> 2D Gel electrophoresis is considered the "Early application of proteomics"
> Now proteomics uses many techs including NMR, Fourier transform infrarred spectrpscopy, array experiments, chip experiments, and most essentially, Mass Spectrometry.

> >“[[Proteomics]] includes not only the **identification and quantification** of proteins, but also the **determination** of their ==localization==, ==modifications, interactions, activities==, and, ultimately, their **function**” [10]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089158491300587X?casa_token=Ex3_B9syPoUAAAAA:5UB5T-5fddnUqjoK87fSncyZkz_o63vWzHbsg7micJ5ycmj5meaGtNoTy9PXJnfzHeyGA4dI#bib10](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.291.5507.1221))
