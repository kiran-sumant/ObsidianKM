Antonym: [[top-down proteomics]]

Intact proteins are first **digested** into smallter peptide sequences based on ==residue-specific proteolytic enzymes==.

[[Week 2 - MS and HPLC|LC-MS]]  is then used to analyse, locate digest peptides and **sequence the wholte protein**

==High-throughput method==, helps form larger number of identification results in less time than top-down proteomics.

Limitation on bottom-up methods is that there is a **low-percentage coverage** of the **protein sequence** in result data due to the limits of Liquid chromatography elution in covering the entire proteome. 

Hence multiple different media and columns need to be utilised in combination depending on what proteins one may look to explore for.
