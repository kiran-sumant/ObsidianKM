Antonym: [[top-down proteomics]]

Intact proteins are first **digested** into smallter peptide sequences based on ==residue-specific proteolytic enzymes==.

[[Week 2 - MS and HPLC|LC-MS]]  is then used to analyse, locate digest peptides and **sequence the wholte protein**

==High-throughput method==, helps form larger number of identification results in less time than top-down proteomics.
