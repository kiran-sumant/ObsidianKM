# Main Idea of Thesis

FUT10 and FUT11 -> POFUT3 and POFUT4

Via [[co-immunoprecipitation]], enzymatic assays, MS and CRISPR knockout, confirmed responsible for **modifying EMI domains**

same "non-canonical ER quality control pathway" for secretion of proteins with EMI domain.

# Details/Quotes

> [!example] POFUT facts
> - POFUT1&2 not responsible for EMI domain in MMRN1, **confirmed** via ==transient transfections==
> - EIC shows that FX KO (obliterates all fucosylation) affects EMI, but NOT POFUT1,2.
> - FUT10,11 confirmed MMRN1 EMI fucosylation *in vitro*
> - FUT11 reaction rate > FUT10 (enzymatic assay)
> - Enzyme activity enhanged by **divalent metal ions (MnCl2>MgCl2>CaCl2>)
> 
> >[!quote]-
> >Equivalent levels of EMI O-fucosylation were also observed in full-129 length MMRN1-transfected WT and POFUT2 KO HEK293T cells

> [!example] POFUT3/4 & EMI
> - EMI can accommodate **two fucose** residues **simultaneously** (seen from experiments in MMRNA)
> - Activity of POFUT4 slightly > POFUT3 at T216 residue, similar at T265
> - POFUT3 kinetics validated via 
> 
> > [!quote]-
> > This aligns with the trend we observed in Fig. 4a, where the concentrations of enzyme and EMI substrate fell within this range, although the difference was207 notably smaller, likely due to the influence of MnCl2 that boosts FUT10 activity (Fig. S9)
