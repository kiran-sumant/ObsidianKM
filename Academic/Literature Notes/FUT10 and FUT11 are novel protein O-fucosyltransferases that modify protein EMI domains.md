# Main Idea of Thesis

FUT10 and FUT11 -> POFUT3 and POFUT4

Via [[co-immunoprecipitation]], enzymatic assays, MS and CRISPR knockout, confirmed responsible for **modifying EMI domains**

same "non-canonical ER quality control pathway" for secretion of proteins with EMI domain.

# Details/Quotes

> [!example] POFUT facts
> - POFUT1&2 not responsible for EMI domain in MMRN1, **confirmed** via ==transient transfections==
> - EIC shows that FX KO (obliterates all fucosylation) affects EMI, but NOT POFUT1,2.
> - FUT10,11 confirmed MMRN1 EMI fucosylation *in vitro*
> - FUT11 reaction rate > FUT10 (enzymatic assay)
> - Enzyme activity enhanged by **divalent metal ions (MnCl2>MgCl2>CaCl2>)
> 
> >[!quote]-
> >Equivalent levels of EMI O-fucosylation were also observed in full-length MMRN1-transfected WT and POFUT2 KO HEK293T cells

> [!example] POFUT3/4 & [[Elastin Microfibril Interface (EMI)|EMI]]
> - EMI can accommodate **two fucose** residues **simultaneously** (seen from experiments in MMRNA)
> - Activity of POFUT4 slightly > POFUT3 at T216 residue, similar at T265
> - POFUT3 kinetics validated via **GDP-Glo Glycosyltransferase assay**
> 
> > [!quote]-
> > This aligns with the trend we observed in Fig. 4a, where the concentrations of enzyme and EMI substrate fell within this range, although the difference was notably smaller, likely due to the influence of MnCl2 that boosts FUT10 activity (Fig. S9)

- POFUT3/4 can act independent of each other (CRISPR/Cas9 KO)
- They are solely responsible for EMI O-fucosylation.

> [!example] Con-Canonical ER quality control pathway 
> - denatured EMI domain doesn't bind, POFUT3/4 only accepts folded protein for modification.
> - POFUT3/4 function in ER rather than Golgi after KO of Golgi GDP-fucose pool
> 
> >[!quote]-
> >To examine if POFUT3 and POFUT4 function in the Golgi, we257 performed transient transfections with the N-terminal EMI construct in WT and SLC35C1 KO258 HEK293T cells62. SLC35C1 encodes the Golgi GDP-fucose transporter. Loss of SLC35C1 leads to259 the depletion of the Golgi GDP-fucose pool, thereby inhibiting the activity of Golgi-localized FUTs.260 As expected, nearly all fucosylation of N-glycan on EMI N136 site was lost in SLC35C1 KO cells261 compared to WT cells, confirming the KO status of the cells (Fig. 6b). In contrast to N-glycan262 fucosylation, equivalent O-fucosylation levels on EMI T216 and T265 sites were observed in WT263 and SLC35C1 KO cells.


> [!quote] "interestingly" quotes
> - "... second fucose was found in close proximity to the primary fucose site in 3D space, and many other EMI domains also possess a threonine at this equivalent site"
> - "It would be intriguing to understand the spatial orientation of these two fucose residues and the catalytic mechanisms involved in their addition to EMI"

It is ==hypothesised== that **EMI structure compacting** is brought about by the **fucose site modifications**, located in the ==middle== of two ==separate, *antiparallel*== $\beta$-strands. the modifications may draw the beta-strands closer together.
> [!quote] 
> Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that a MMRN1 T216A mutant displayed a reduced fucosylation level at T265 site, indicating that the presence of the T216 fucose facilitates the addition of the T265 fucose.
