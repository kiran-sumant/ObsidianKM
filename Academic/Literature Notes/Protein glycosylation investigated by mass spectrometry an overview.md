# Details/Quotes
- Glycosylation is post translational modification
- Covalent bonding of oligosaccharide/*glycan* to a polypeptide chain

Glycans are **secondary gene products**

## N-glycans
- Synthesised in [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (see ==oligosaccharyltransferase==)
- Chaperone guided folding occurs

> [!example] Statements
> - N-glycan role and function spans the Eukaryotic domain
> - less complexity in plant N-glycans than in mammals' glycoproteins
> >[!quote] (semi-unrelated) quote
> >The functional role ofÂ _N_-glycans dictated from the specific folding of glycoproteins drives the evolutionary changes in the precise signalling of folding control in eukaryotes [[12](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Nat.+Rev.+Mol.+Cell+Biol.&title=Glycosylation-directed+quality+control+of+protein+folding&author=C.+Xu&author=D.T.W.+Ng&volume=16&publication_year=2015&pages=742-752&pmid=26465718&doi=10.1038/nrm4073&)]

## O-glycans


> [!example] Statements
> - biosynthesis is ==kingdom-specific==
> 

## Implications
- Immunity and inflammation: ==stimulated t-cells, cytokine release, immune receptors==
- Genetic defects in glycosylation are **often embryonice lethal**
- Changes in protein glycosylation seen at *both beginning and end* of **cancer progression** and **metastasis**.

## Experimentation
- MALDI-MS or LC-MS/MS - using [[CID]], [[ECD]] and [[ETD]]
- **Multiple reaction monitoring** approach w/ **Targeted mass spectrometry** ([[MRM]])
- **High-energy collision dissociation (HCD)**: frag method for peptides with PTMs to provide sequence info and ==localisation of modification sites.==
