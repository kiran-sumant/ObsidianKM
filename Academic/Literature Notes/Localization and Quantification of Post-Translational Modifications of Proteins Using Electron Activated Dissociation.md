# Main Idea of Thesis

PTMs are "diverse, dynamic and cruicial to large variety of cellular processes and signalling".

PTM analysis remains challenging in 2023 due to potential low PTM stoichiometry, neutral loss, multiple PTMs per proteolytic peptide.

CID is commonly used, but results in ==neutral loss== and ==incomplete peptide sequencing==.

Article focuses on [[EAD]] for PTM characterisation, site localisaiton, and peptide quantification.

Uses PRM for final analyses.

Finds "electron-based fragmentation preserves the malonyl group from neutral losses" where malonyl is a highly labile PTM.

Demonstrates high reproducability, quantification accuracy and stronger peptide sequence coverage.
