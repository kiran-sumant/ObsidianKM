# Main Idea of Thesis

PTMs are "diverse, dynamic and cruicial to large variety of cellular processes and signalling".

PTM analysis remains challenging in 2023 due to potential low PTM stoichiometry, neutral loss, multiple PTMs per proteolytic peptide.

CID is commonly used, but results in ==neutral loss== and ==incomplete peptide sequencing==.

Article focuses on [[EAD]] for PTM characterisation, site localisaiton, and peptide quantification.

Uses PRM for final analyses.

Finds "electron-based fragmentation preserves the malonyl group from neutral losses" where malonyl is a highly labile PTM.

Demonstrates high reproducability, quantification accuracy and stronger peptide sequence coverage.

> >In this study, we present a first proof-of-concept of EAD fragmentation performed on a novel QqTOF mass spectrometer to analyze malonylated, succinylated, doubly malonylated-acetylated, and phosphorylated peptides. We assessed the performances of EAD versus CID to confidently and accurately identify, site localize, and quantify PTMs using the same MS platform to limit the varying factors to the fragmentation type. We analyzed a series of biologically relevant synthetic modified peptides using targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM or MRMHR) assays (32) performed on a QqTOF system ([Figure 1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jasms.3c00144?casa_token=FSrZ2lIcPxMAAAAA%3AWptDQFWiwNZM34clc8Hxfn1crqskfTV0lWNWmtjiltMYg60eruKyTyU5ZuQGcH7DRY0LjFsOweFqwHA#fig1)). We explored a range of EAD KE values to determine optimal values, which keep labile modifications intact and provide comprehensive peptide fragmentation coverage, that generates strong PTM site-localizing ions, with a particular focus on malonylation and phosphorylation. We also investigated the capabilities of the trap-and-release technology to increase sensitivity when combined with EAD fragmentation.
