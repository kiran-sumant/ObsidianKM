# Details/Quotes

> [!statement] 
> Link between EMI and NOTCH is here:
> - O-fucose glycans modulate protein functions through interactions within and external to the molecule.
> >[!quote]-
> >Recent evidence has demonstrated that O-fucose glycans modulate protein function through both intermolecular and intramolecular interactions (43). In co-crystal structures of portions of the NOTCH1 ligand-binding domain with its ligands \[NOTCH1-DLL4 (67) and NOTCH1-JAG1 (68)\], O-fucose residues on NOTCH1 EGF8 and 12 were found to directly interact with the ligands.

> [!Example] EMI and how it is unique
> - Domain is **consistently singular** (unlike EGF and TSR repeats)
> - Located at the **N-terminus** (not slap-bang in the middle of the protein)
> - Seen in all proteins of the [[EMILIN|EMILIN/Multimerin family]], which can form **homotrimers**
> 
> >[!quote]-
> >However, unlike EGF repeats and TSRs which are frequently found embedded within proteins as tandem repeats, the EMI domain is consistently singular and located at the N-terminus of proteins (150).

Used **Time-dependent enzymatic assay** to compare kinetics (*Km and Vmax*)
