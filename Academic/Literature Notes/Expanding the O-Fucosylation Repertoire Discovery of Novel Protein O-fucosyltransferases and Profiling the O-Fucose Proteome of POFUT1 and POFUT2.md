> >Recent evidence has demonstrated that O-fucose glycans modulate protein function through both intermolecular and intramolecular interactions (43). In co-crystal structures of portions of the NOTCH1 ligand-binding domain with its ligands \[NOTCH1-DLL4 (67) and NOTCH1-JAG1 (68)\], O-fucose residues on NOTCH1 EGF8 and 12 were found to directly interact with the ligands.
