# Main Idea of Thesis

- ==[[bottom-up proteomics|Bottom-up (shotgun) proteomics]]== is the core approach for the field, due to it's ***specifity, sensitivity, versatility***, and *wide range of analysis* offered over the span of the proteome.
- High-efficiency LC and high-sensitivity MS instruments to shake up and pioneer new ways of looking at proteins, proteoforms and their interactions.
- Looks at what changes need to be made to a ==conventional-flow LC== system to emulate the sensitivity/result quality seen in that of a **Nano-LC/MS system**, looking at performance in exploratory proteomics methods.

# Details/Quotes

> [!example] Results 
> 1. Evidence of peak width decrease with increase in elution speed seen (2.1s to 2.0s from 102-136μL/min), *but* **peak intensities decrease** with faster flow rates.
> 2. Increase in column length yielded above-benchmark performance in data, allowing for analysis identifying more proteins.==This allows for higher flow rates with similar MS performance==. 
> 3. DMSO enhances MS signal in nanoLC-MS.
> 4. Performance adjustments in the conventional flow LC statistically matched performance of nanoLC-MS.

> >1. "The trend suggested that the separation efficiency could be further improved. On the other hand, despite adjusted desolvation parameters, the peak MS intensities decreased with faster flow rates due to the concentration-dependent behavior of the HESI-II source."
> >2. "The 250 mm microbore column provided peaks 1.9 s wide in the steep gradient and, in line with theory, _P_c increased to 287. (28) Concurrently, the peak heights increased 1.2-fold (experiment s12; [Figure](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525?casa_token=m_UMmPcbNo4AAAAA%3ArfkQ2-GJRLqP6_5Wt1nFP0u4JJH75bsBEqOXrYYC4105Tp5jc6jXpmWRB3TThhPIpEXCEYcAtTU0zZc#fig6) [6](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525?casa_token=m_UMmPcbNo4AAAAA%3ArfkQ2-GJRLqP6_5Wt1nFP0u4JJH75bsBEqOXrYYC4105Tp5jc6jXpmWRB3TThhPIpEXCEYcAtTU0zZc#fig6) and [Figure S-6](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525/suppl_file/ac8b00525_si_001.pdf)). For the first time in the study, the LC–MS analysis of HeLa peptides yielded at least one of the main indicators, namely, the number of peptides, superior to the benchmark analysis (experiment no. 12; [Figure](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525?casa_token=m_UMmPcbNo4AAAAA%3ArfkQ2-GJRLqP6_5Wt1nFP0u4JJH75bsBEqOXrYYC4105Tp5jc6jXpmWRB3TThhPIpEXCEYcAtTU0zZc#fig2) [2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525?casa_token=m_UMmPcbNo4AAAAA%3ArfkQ2-GJRLqP6_5Wt1nFP0u4JJH75bsBEqOXrYYC4105Tp5jc6jXpmWRB3TThhPIpEXCEYcAtTU0zZc#fig2)). A considerable increase was achieved in identified peptides, arguably due to higher identification rate (62.1%) and lower identification redundancy (1.29)"
> >3. "decrease in identification redundancy caused by rarer occurrence of peptides identified from more than one precursor charge state ([Figure](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525?casa_token=m_UMmPcbNo4AAAAA%3ArfkQ2-GJRLqP6_5Wt1nFP0u4JJH75bsBEqOXrYYC4105Tp5jc6jXpmWRB3TThhPIpEXCEYcAtTU0zZc#fig9) [9](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525?casa_token=m_UMmPcbNo4AAAAA%3ArfkQ2-GJRLqP6_5Wt1nFP0u4JJH75bsBEqOXrYYC4105Tp5jc6jXpmWRB3TThhPIpEXCEYcAtTU0zZc#fig9) C). This confirmed the charge state coalescence effect of DMSO in microbore LC–MS. Another difference was found in the distribution of precursor and PSM charge states, respectively, which shifted toward lower values ([Figure](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525?casa_token=m_UMmPcbNo4AAAAA%3ArfkQ2-GJRLqP6_5Wt1nFP0u4JJH75bsBEqOXrYYC4105Tp5jc6jXpmWRB3TThhPIpEXCEYcAtTU0zZc#fig9) [9](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525?casa_token=m_UMmPcbNo4AAAAA%3ArfkQ2-GJRLqP6_5Wt1nFP0u4JJH75bsBEqOXrYYC4105Tp5jc6jXpmWRB3TThhPIpEXCEYcAtTU0zZc#fig9)A,B and [Figure S-8](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00525/suppl_file/ac8b00525_si_001.pdf)). This corroborated the DMSO effect on reduction of peptide charge state. (38,39)"
> >4. "Superior stability of the conventional-flow LC–MS system in terms of both retention time and MS response allowed reliable quantitation of proteins even with one order concentration differences using a label-free approach. In addition, the iTRAQ quantification showed itself to be rather less burdened by the precursor coisolation issue in comparing to results obtained earlier using nanoLC–MS."


**Conclusion**: Conventional-flow, with adjustments, can **match performance** of NanoLC-MS. This is important because the NanoLC system + add-ons racks up large expenses, when regular hardware can produce similar results. All a question of budget and time, but ==adjustments can be made in accordance to what the experiment/research question demands.==
