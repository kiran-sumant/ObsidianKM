# Main Idea of Thesis

- ==[[bottom-up proteomics|Bottom-up (shotgun) proteomics]]== is the core approach for the field, due to it's ***specifity, sensitivity, versatility***, and *wide range of analysis* offered over the span of the proteome.
- High-efficiency LC and high-sensitivity MS instruments to shake up and pioneer new ways of looking at proteins, proteoforms and their interactions.
- Looks at what changes need to be made to a ==conventional-flow LC== system to emulate the sensitivity/result quality seen in that of a **Nano-LC/MS system**, looking at performance in exploratory proteomics methods.

# Details/Quotes

> [!example] Results 
> 1. Evidence of peak width decrease with increase in elution speed seen (2.1s to 2.0s from 102-136μL/min), *but* **peak intensities decrease** with faster flow rates.
> 2. Increase in column length yielded above-benchmark performance in data, allowing for analysis identifying more proteins.
> 3. 
> 
> >[!quote]
> >1. "The trend suggested that the separation efficiency could be further improved. On the other hand, despite adjusted desolvation parameters, the peak MS intensities decreased with faster flow rates due to the concentration-dependent behavior of the HESI-II source."
