Also Synthetic protein condensates, are "distinct structures assembled in living cells that concentrate molecules via phase separation in a confined subcellular compartment ([Quian, ZG. et al, 2002](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01203-3))" 

Uses ==phase separation== to **concentrate** reactants, helps drive higher reaction output in otherwise suboptimal conditions (especially considering reversible reactions or high $\delta$ )
