# Main Idea of Thesis

MMRN1- "homopolymeric, adhesive, platelet and endothelial protein", binds to von Willebrand factor (VWF), enhances platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen.

Examine MMRN1 deficiency effect on platelet adhesion, molecular motifs in fibrillar collagen binding MMRN1.

Finds that "==GPAGPOGPX== sequences ==in== **collagens I, II, and III**" enhance activated human platelet adhesion to collagen ==synergistically==.
