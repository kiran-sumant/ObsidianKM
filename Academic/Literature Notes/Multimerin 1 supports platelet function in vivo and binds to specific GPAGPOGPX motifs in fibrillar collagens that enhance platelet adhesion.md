# Main Idea of Thesis

MMRN1- "homopolymeric, adhesive, platelet and endothelial protein", binds to von Willebrand factor (VWF), enhances platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen.

Examine MMRN1 deficiency effect on platelet adhesion, molecular motifs in fibrillar collagen binding MMRN1.

Finds that "==GPAGPOGPX== sequences ==in== **collagens I, II, and III**" enhance activated human platelet adhesion to collagen ==synergistically==.

> >rMMRN1 binding to immobilized human FG (±pre‐treatment with 0.2 U/mL thrombin to induce fibrin formation), FN, or triple‐helical collagen peptides was evaluated based on methods described, [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7898486/#jth15171-bib-0006) using Immulon 2 HB flat‐bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated (overnight, 4°C) with 1 µg/well protein or peptide.
