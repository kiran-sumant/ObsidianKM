# Details/Quotes
> [!statement] O-Fucose biology
> Fucosylation is common in proteins and lipids. it's a glycosylation reaction (*not to be confused with fucosylation*)
> >[!quote]-
> >The fucose residues typically occur as terminal or core modifications of the glycan, added by Golgi-localized fucosyltransferases
> 
> - Modifications have functions in immunology, blood group antigens, etc.
> - Our interest is in **O-linkage** of fucose to hydroxyl groups
>
> > [!quote]-
> >  In contrast, fucose can be directly added to proteins via an _O_-linkage to hydroxyl groups of [Serines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/serine "Learn more about Serines from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") or Threonines of folded Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGF) repeats and [Thrombospondin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/thrombospondin "Learn more about Thrombospondin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") Type 1 Repeats (TSR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

# Known PTM Process for O-fucosylation

> [!warning] Modification Description
> - O-fucosylation is done via ==Serine== or ==Threonine== hydroxyl grps
> - Modifies Epidermal Growth Factor-like ([[EGF]]) repeats & Thromospondin type-1 ([[TSR]]) repeats in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER)
> - **EGF-repeats = [[POFUT1]]**
> - **TSR = [[POFUT2]]**
> 
> >[!quote]- 
> >EGF repeats and TSRs are small protein modules characterized by three [disulfide bonds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/disulfide-bond "Learn more about disulfide bonds from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X18301532?via%3Dihub#fig0005)). Protein _O_-fucosyltransferases 1 and 2 (POFUT1 and POFUT2) add _O_-linked fucose to folded EGF repeats and TSRs, respectively

Fig. Modification of Motifs by O-fucose glycans. 
a) (left) shows disulphide bonding via green lines, beta strands via arrows. Site of O-fucosylation and GlcNAc elongation indicated by red triangle and blue square, respectively. 
(right) shows **POFUT1 modification's [[consensus sequence]]** and glycans additions with relevant enzymes:
1. POFUT1 - Fucose
2. FRINGE - GlcNAc
3. B4GALT1 - Galactose
4. ST6GAL1 - Sialic acid
b) [[NOTCH1]] modified by **GlcNAcβ1-3Fucose disaccharide**. Fucose in red, GlcNAc in blue, disulfide bonds in green, oxygen atoms highlighted in red.
c) group 1 and 2 TSR depends on C-location for disulfide bond. POFUT2 consensus sequence shown, and with two glycan additions:
1. POFUT2 - Fucose
2. B3GLCT - Glucose
d) Structure of [ADAMTS13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/adamts13 "Learn more about ADAMTS13 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") TSR1 modified with Glucoseβ1-3-Fucose disaccharide. Fucose in red, glucose in blue, disulfide bonds in green.

> [!statement] Newfound 2019 facts
> Evidence for **direct intermolecular interactions** of fucose on EGF repeats, to ==stabilise structure== -> increase in ER folding rate
> >[!quote]-
> >Recent evidence suggests that the _O_-linked fucose on EGF repeats can participate directly in intermolecular interactions with binding partners. In addition, _O_-fucose participates in intramolecular interactions with neighboring [amino acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/amino-acids "Learn more about amino acids from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of correctly disulfide-bonded EGF repeats and TSRs. These interactions are proposed to stabilize the structure and as a consequence accelerate the overall rate of folding in the ER

> [!example] Implications
> - Dowling-Degos Disease - POFUT1 mutation, rare skin condition
> - POFUT1 -> several types of cancer
> - POFUT gene knockout is **embryonic lethal** in mice.
> - Defects from POFUT1 KO similar to NOTCH1 KO
> - Adamts9 KO similar to POFUT2 KO
> - Evidence that O-fucosylation is essential for function.

> >Loss of _Pofut1_ causes embryonic lethality with defects in [somite](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/somite "Learn more about somite from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), [neural tube](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/neural-tube "Learn more about neural tube from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), heart, and [blood vessel development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/angiogenesis "Learn more about blood vessel development from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), similar to _Notch1_ knockout. Similar loss of Notch function is seen in _O-fut1_ (_POFUT1_ homolog in flies) mutants in flies. Loss of _Pofut2_ in mice causes early embryo lethality resulting from abnormalities in [gastrulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/gastrulation "Learn more about gastrulation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and axis elongation, similar to _Adamts9_ mutants

> [!example] NOTCH1 signalling
> - Elongation/extension of fucose with other glycans ==not essential== for Notch function, but for **modulating notch signalling**. 
> >[!quote]-
> >Reduced [Notch signaling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/notch-signaling-pathway "Learn more about Notch signaling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in Fringe mutants provides evidence that extension of the _O_-fucose with GlcNAc is not essential for Notch function, but rather is important for modulating Notch signaling. Fringe mutations in flies affects a subset of Notch functions, especially in formation of the wing [[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X18301532?via%3Dihub#bib0125)]. Mutations in either mouse or human _Lfng_/_LFNG_ show skeletal defects consistent with reduced Notch signaling, but are less severe than _Pofut1_ or _Notch1_ mutants.
