# Known PTM Process for O-fucosylation

> [!warning] Modification Description
> - O-fucosylation is done via ==Serine== or ==Threonine== hydroxyl grps
> - Modifies Epidermal Growth Factor-like ([[EGF]]) repeats & Thromospondin type-1 ([[TSR]]) repeats in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER)
> - **EGF-repeats = [[POFUT1]]**
> - **TSR = [[POFUT2]]**

> >EGF repeats and TSRs are small protein modules characterized by three [disulfide bonds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/disulfide-bond "Learn more about disulfide bonds from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X18301532?via%3Dihub#fig0005)). Protein _O_-fucosyltransferases 1 and 2 (POFUT1 and POFUT2) add _O_-linked fucose to folded EGF repeats and TSRs, respectively

> [!statement] Newfound 2019 facts
> Evidence for **direct intermolecular interactions** of fucose on EGF repeats, to ==stabilise structure== -> increase in ER folding rate
> >[!quote]-
> >Recent evidence suggests that the _O_-linked fucose on EGF repeats can participate directly in intermolecular interactions with binding partners. In addition, _O_-fucose participates in intramolecular interactions with neighboring [amino acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/amino-acids "Learn more about amino acids from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of correctly disulfide-bonded EGF repeats and TSRs. These interactions are proposed to stabilize the structure and as a consequence accelerate the overall rate of folding in the ER

# Evidence of Function

> [!example] Implications
> - Dowling-Degos Disease - POFUT1 mutation, rare skin condition
> - POFUT1 -> several types of cancer
> - POFUT gene knockout is **embryonic lethal** in mice.
> - Defects from POFUT1 KO similar to NOTCH1 KO
> - Adamts9 KO similar to POFUT2 KO
> - Evidence that O-fucosylation is essential for function.

> >Loss of _Pofut1_ causes embryonic lethality with defects in [somite](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/somite "Learn more about somite from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), [neural tube](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/neural-tube "Learn more about neural tube from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), heart, and [blood vessel development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/angiogenesis "Learn more about blood vessel development from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), similar to _Notch1_ knockout. Similar loss of Notch function is seen in _O-fut1_ (_POFUT1_ homolog in flies) mutants in flies. Loss of _Pofut2_ in mice causes early embryo lethality resulting from abnormalities in [gastrulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/gastrulation "Learn more about gastrulation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and axis elongation, similar to _Adamts9_ mutants

> [!statement] NOTCH1 signalling
> Elongation/extension of fucose with other glycans ==not essential== for Notch function, but for **modulating notch signalling**. 
> >[!quote]-
> >Reduced [Notch signalling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/notch-signaling-pathway "Learn more about Notch signaling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in Fringe mutants provides evidence that extension of the _O_-fucose with GlcNAc is not essential for Notch function, but rather is important for modulating Notch signalling. Fringe mutations in flies affects a subset of Notch functions, especially in formation of the wing [[25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X18301532?via%3Dihub#bib0125)]. Mutations in either mouse or human _Lfng_/_LFNG_ show skeletal defects consistent with reduced Notch signalling, but are less severe than _Pofut1_ or _Notch1_ mutants.

> [!statement] 
> Some protein functions are shown to be more dependent on protein function than others 
> >[!quote]-
> >... both _Pofut2_ and _Adamts9_-null mice are embryonic lethal, but loss of _B3GLCT_ in PPS is not. Since ADAMTS9 is modified with the Glucoseβ1-3Fucose [disaccharide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/disaccharide "Learn more about disaccharide from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") [[49](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X18301532?via%3Dihub#bib0245)], this suggests that ADAMTS9 function is more-dependent on POFUT2 than B3GLCT.

# Mechanism of Function

> [!example] Influences intermolecular interaction with binding partners
> - _O_-fucosylation by POFUT1 is a highly efficient process in cells, **not site selective**
> - (context) 36 EGF repeats on Notch, 17 sites modded with O-fucose
> - Figure shows EGF12 in **direct contact** with **backbone and side-chain** residues in both ligands.  
> - Key roles of EGF8 and 12 in supporting **fringe enzyme modification** of Notch that boosts LL1-mediated **NOTCH1 activation.**
> - ==Proposed that TSRs may have similar interactions==
> 
> >[!quote]-
> >![[Pasted image 20240402161527.png]]

> [!example] O-Fucosylation forms interactions that stabilised folded repeat motifs, via **ER quality control pathway**
> Pathway is:
> - Novel - unlike classical ER QC systems, POFUTs recognise folded domains
> - Non-canonical - ==modification is/can be done post-folding==
> 
> > [!quote]- 
> > "Further evidence that these enzymes recognize folded structures came from co-crystal structures of POFUT1 and an EGF repeat [[15••](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X18301532?via%3Dihub#bib0075)], and POFUT2 and a TSR [[14••](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X18301532?via%3Dihub#bib0070)]."
