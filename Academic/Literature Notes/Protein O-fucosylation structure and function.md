# Main Idea of Thesis

To describe and map the functions of O-linked fucose within the protein they modify, how they interact with their and other proteins, and the biological importance of these interactions.

# Details/Quotes
> [!statement] O-Fucose biology
> Fucosylation is common in proteins and lipids. it's a glycosylation reaction (*not to be confused with fucosylation*)
> >[!quote]-
> >The fucose residues typically occur as terminal or core modifications of the glycan, added by Golgi-localized fucosyltransferases
> 
> - Modifications have functions in immunology, blood group antigens, etc.
> - Our interest is in **O-linkage** of fucose to hydroxyl groups
>
> > [!quote]-
> >  In contrast, fucose can be directly added to proteins via an _O_-linkage to hydroxyl groups of [Serines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/serine "Learn more about Serines from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") or Threonines of folded Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGF) repeats and [Thrombospondin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/thrombospondin "Learn more about Thrombospondin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") Type 1 Repeats (TSR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
> 
> - O-fucosylation is done via ==Serine== or ==Threonine== hydroxyl grps
> - commonly on Epidermal Growth Factor-like [[EGF repeats]] & Thromospondin type-1 [[TSR repeats]] in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]
