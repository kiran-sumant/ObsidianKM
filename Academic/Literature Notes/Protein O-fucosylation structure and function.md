# Details/Quotes
> [!statement] O-Fucose biology
> Fucosylation is common in proteins and lipids. it's a glycosylation reaction (*not to be confused with fucosylation*)
> >[!quote]-
> >The fucose residues typically occur as terminal or core modifications of the glycan, added by Golgi-localized fucosyltransferases
> 
> - Modifications have functions in immunology, blood group antigens, etc.
> - Our interest is in **O-linkage** of fucose to hydroxyl groups
