# Main Idea of Thesis

Chemically altered fucose [[analogs]] can be utilised for altering fucose-dependent processes to probe fucose function.

Summarises known roles of fucose in mammals. Also discuss therapeutic advances for cancer directly resultant from knowledge advancement in fucose studies.

# [[Fucose|6-deoxy-L/D-galactose]]

- Has both **[[enantiomers]]** and **[[epimers]]**.
- Epimer has $\alpha$/$\beta$ confirmation for D-fucose enantiomer
- can be *furanose* (5 membered ring) or *pyranose* (6-membered ring) {includes oxygen as a member}.

> [!example] Fucose be like "I'm not like the other sugars"
> - ==L-configuration== of chiral carbon, where **all natural mammalian** sugars *exist as D-config*
> - ==Lacks hydroxyl== group on ==C-6 carbon==
> - Relatively *common* glycan *modification* in lipids and proteins (*7.6% of oligosaccharides studies have it*)

> >It is unique in having an L-configuration, whereas all other naturally occurring sugars in mammals exist in the D-conformation (Figure 1). It is also structurally distinct in lacking a hydroxyl group on the C-6 carbon (note contrast with D-galactose in Figure 1). A study of 3299 mammalian oligosaccharides revealed that fucose is found in 7.2% of oligosaccharides studied, second only to sialic acid...
