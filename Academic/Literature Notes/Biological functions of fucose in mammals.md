# Main Idea of Thesis

Chemically altered fucose [[analogs]] can be utilised for altering fucose-dependent processes to probe fucose function.

Summarises known roles of fucose in mammals. Also discuss therapeutic advances for cancer directly resultant from knowledge advancement in fucose studies.

# [[Fucose|6-deoxy-L/D-galactose]]

- Has both **[[enantiomers]]** and **[[epimers]]**.
- Epimer has $\alpha$/$\beta$ confirmation for D-fucose enantiomer
- can be *furanose* (5 membered ring) or *pyranose* (6-membered ring) {includes oxygen as a member}.

> [!example] Fucose be like "I'm not like the other sugars"
> - ==L-configuration== of chiral carbon, where **all natural mammalian** sugars *exist as D-config*
> - ==Lacks hydroxyl== group on ==C-6 carbon==
> - Relatively *common* glycan *modification* in lipids and proteins (*7.6% of oligosaccharides studies have it*)

> >It is unique in having an L-configuration, whereas all other naturally occurring sugars in mammals exist in the D-conformation (Figure 1). It is also structurally distinct in lacking a hydroxyl group on the C-6 carbon (note contrast with D-galactose in Figure 1). A study of 3299 mammalian oligosaccharides revealed that fucose is found in 7.2% of oligosaccharides studied, second only to sialic acid...

> [!example] Statements
> - can be modded into N-, O- terminals, or **lipid-linked oligosaccharide chains**
> - also linked to ==Serine or Threonine in some proteins==

> [!example] Fucose Glycan Structure
> - ==Mucin O-GalNAc glycans extension==, and Direct attachment to Ser or Thr, are the main modification methods for **O-glycans**
> - 13 known FUTs for synthesis of fucosylated glycans

> >Two types of _O_-glycans can be modified with fucose: mucin _O_-GalNAc glycans are initiated by the attachment of _N_-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine; alternatively fucose can be directly attached to serine or threonine residues within the appropriate consensus sequence of a subset of proteins. There are 13 known fucosyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of this group of fucosylated glycans

> [!example] Fucose synthesis process
> - **GDP fucose** used by FUTs to modify target protein/lipids.
> - most fucose comes from **==de novo synthesis pathway==**
> 
> > [!quote] 
> > GDP-fucose is synthesized through two pathways—the de novo synthesis pathway and the fucose salvage pathway (Figure 3). The de novo pathway **synthesizes** GDP-fucose from **==GDP-mannose==** through a ==three-step reaction catalyzed== by *two enzymes*, GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-keto-6-deoxymannose 3,5 epimerase (**the FX protein**) (Ginsburg 1960; Tonetti et al. 1996).
