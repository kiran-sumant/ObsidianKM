# Main Idea of Thesis

- MAGP-1/2 are **components** of **extracellular matrix microfibrils**
- Interact with ==fibrillin== (microfibril core component)
- Modulate notch signalling
- bind to
	1. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$\beta$)
	2. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)

# Details/Quotes

**Microfibrillar-associated glycoprotein-1 and -2**

- Bond covalently through matrix binding domain, near the c-terminus
- 

> [!example] MAGP and [[notch signalling]]
> - reference of MAGPs for **tandem EGF-like motifs**
> - Interacts with Fibulins, JAG1, JAG2, DELTA1, [[NOTCH1]] and [[MEGF6]] (all contain EGFL domain)
