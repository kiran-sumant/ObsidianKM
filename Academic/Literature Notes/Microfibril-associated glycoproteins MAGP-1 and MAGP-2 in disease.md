# Main Idea of Thesis

- MAGP-1/2 are **components** of **extracellular matrix microfibrils**
- Interact with ==fibrillin== (microfibril core component)
- Modulate notch signalling
- bind to
	1. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$\beta$)
	2. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)

| ==growth factor binding== of TGF$\beta$ via attaching to fibrillin, blocking growth factor binding to microfibrils. Or, via "synergistic interaction with microfibrils to **influence growth factor availability**" | [[notch signalling\|Notch Signalling]]: Induced Jagged1 protein "shedding from the cell surface" regulating the protein's activity. |
| Notch Signalling: Both MFAP2 and 5 have strong binding preference for tandem EGF-lie motifs. Interact with Jagged1, Jagged2, [[NOTCH1]], [[MEGF6]], and Delta1.                                                     | <                                                                                                                                   |
