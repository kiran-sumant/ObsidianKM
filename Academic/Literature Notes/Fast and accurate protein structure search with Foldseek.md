# Main Idea of Thesis

Foldseek has effective use as a "structural searching algorithm" for protein structure matches.

It aligns query proteins structure against database proteins via "description" of tertiary amino acid interactions within proteins

Very computationally efficient compared to Dali, TM-align and CE.
