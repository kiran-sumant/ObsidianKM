| Fragmentation of gas phase peptide ions induced by collision with **neutral gas molecules**. Fragmentation occurs in weakest bond. | Allows ions to pass through ==C-trap== into HCD cell where **low energy CID** takes place. Fragment then ==return to C-trap== before analysis |     | Interactions btwn ==gas-phase ions== and ==free low-energy electrons==. Fragmentation induced by electron energy transfer. |     |
