| Fragmentation of gas phase peptide ions induced by collision with **neutral gas molecules**. Fragmentation occurs in weakest bond. | Allows ions to pass through ==C-trap== into HCD cell where **low energy CID** takes place. Fragment then ==return to C-trap== before analysis | Interactions btwn ==gas-phase ions== and ==free low-energy electrons==. Fragmentation induced by electron energy transfer. Best for **Specialised experiments** not for routine analysis. | **Free electrons** fragment ==singly charged full-length proteins==. Creates **intermediate radical state protein ions**, results in fragmentation. |                                                                                                                            |
