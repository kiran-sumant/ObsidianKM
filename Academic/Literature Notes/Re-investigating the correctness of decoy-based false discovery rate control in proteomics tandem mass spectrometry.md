# Main Idea of Thesis

Open modification database search strategy:- Relaxes the rigidity of peptide mass matching to observed precursor.

Expands from 
A. T. Kong, F. V. Leprevost, D. M. Avtonomov, D. Mellacheruvu, and A. I. Nesvizhskii. MSFragger: ultrafast and comprehensive peptide identification in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Nature Methods, 14(5):513–520, 2017.

"Kong _et al_. reported that their empirical results suggest a problem with false discovery (FDR) control in the narrow window setting."

Finds a potential problem with FDR control in machine learning post processors ==percolator== and ==peptideprophet==. 

However, accounting for chimeric spectra as well as for variation in candidate amt between  open and narrow searches, insufficient evidence for problematic outcome control for FDR.
