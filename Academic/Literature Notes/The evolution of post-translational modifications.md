# Details/Quotes
> [!example] Statements 
> - PTMs are regulate protein activity and function via chemical modification of protein residues.
> - They are a faster mechanism for phenotypic diversity than genetic variation.
> - Thus PTM divergence adds a variable to evolution, adding features for natural selection

> >[!quote]-
> >Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are chemical modifications that can regulate the activity and function of proteins. From an evolutionary perspective, they also represent a fast mechanism for the generation of phenotypic diversity and divergence.
