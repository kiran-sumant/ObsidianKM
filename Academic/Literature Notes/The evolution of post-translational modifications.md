# Details/Quotes
> [!example] The Gist 
> - PTMs are regulate protein activity and function via chemical modification of protein residues.
> - They are a faster mechanism for phenotypic diversity than genetic variation.
> - Thus PTM divergence adds a variable to evolution, adding features for natural selection
> 
> >[!quote]-
> >Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are chemical modifications that can regulate the activity and function of proteins. From an evolutionary perspective, they also represent a fast mechanism for the generation of phenotypic diversity and divergence.

> [!example] Historical PTM findings
> - Experiment done investigating phosphorylation and acetylation to predict interaction effects of the modifications
> - Global protein binding is more impacted by PTM crosstalk than Local binding effects
>
> > [!quote]-
> > The results revealed that the local effect of a PTM on binding correlates poorly with PTM conservation (in terms of sequence conservation) and that the global effect is heavily impacted by PTM crosstalkÂ [33](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Molecular%20dynamics%20shows%20complex%20interplay%20and%20long-range%20effects%20of%20post-translational%20modifications%20in%20yeast%20protein%20interactions&publication_year=2021&author=N.%20%C5%A0o%C5%A1tari%C4%87&author=V.%20van%20Noort))
