Image Mass Spectrometry

- Helps map spatial disribution of molecules with a high chemical specificity.

It's advantages include **nullifying the requirement of tagging of molecular targets** and allowing for the **measure of a large number of ions concurrently in a single experiment**

Con(?): ==Computationally Heavy.==
Requires methods for:
- Spetral preprocessing,
- Data format/reformatting
- [[Dimensionality Reduction|dimensionality reduction]]
-
