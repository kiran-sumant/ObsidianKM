## What got covered:

- Systematic Cataloging of proteins and their transformation into high-specificity assays to quantify components
- PTM analysis, focusing on **completeness of measurement** and how the community **assigns function to PTM sites**.
- MS-based techniques that can quantify thousands of proteins across large sample no's with **high reproducability**

From this it is possible to ==uncover systemic malfunctions== in protein chemistry and the biochemical ecosystem of cells and intercellular interaction which may be difficult to locate through classical research methods.
