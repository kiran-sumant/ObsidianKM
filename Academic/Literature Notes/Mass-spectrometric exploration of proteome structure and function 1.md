Two strategies exist for proteome exploration:
1. *Conventional method* - protein isolation, followed by analysis relevant to proposed structure and function (biochemical analysis).
2. **Large scale, systematic proteome database generation**, can be also combined in analysis with other multi-omic data.

Both methods are greatly accelerated by developments in mass spec technique.
