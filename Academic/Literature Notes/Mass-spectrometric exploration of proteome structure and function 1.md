# Main Idea of Thesis

Another review **bruh**

> "Describing and understanding
> the complete and quantitative proteome as well as its structure,
> function and dynamics is a central and fundamental challenge of biology."

## What got covered:

- Systematic Cataloging of proteins and their transformation into high-specificity assays to quantify components
- PTM analysis, focusing on **completeness of measurement** and how the community **assigns function to PTM sites**.
- MS-based techniques that can quantify thousands of proteins across large sample no's with **high reproducability**

From this it is possible to ==uncover systemic malfunctions== in protein chemistry and the biochemical ecosystem of cells and intercellular interaction which may be difficult to locate through classical research methods.

# Details/Quotes

> [!example] Proteome Exploration 
> Two strategies exist for proteome exploration:
> 1. *Conventional method* - protein isolation, followed by analysis relevant to proposed structure and function (biochemical analysis).
> 2. **Large scale, systematic proteome database generation**, can be also combined in analysis with other multi-omic data.
> 
> Both methods are greatly accelerated by developments in mass spec technique.

> > "They can also **systematically identify** and **localize** ==modified amino acids== in the polypeptide chain as well as **determine** the ==composition, stoichiometry and topology== of the ==subunits== of multiprotein ==complexes== and even contribute to ***determining their structure***."
