# Main Idea of Thesis

- PTMs play a key role in many biochemical and cell signalling systems
- Therefore, proteome-level **PTM characterisation** is vital for ==investigating protein function== in the context of complex processes.
- Talks about the approached developed by the group discussing how to overcome limitations in mass spec with new methods.
