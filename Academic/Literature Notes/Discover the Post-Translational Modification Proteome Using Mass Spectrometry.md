# Main Idea of Thesis

- PTMs play a key role in many biochemical and cell signalling systems
- Therefore, proteome-level **PTM characterisation** is vital for ==investigating protein function== in the context of complex processes.
- Talks about the **approached developed** by the group discussing how to ==overcome== limitations in ==mass spec== with ==new methods==.

# Details/Quotes

> [!statement] The Gist
> - PTMs are diverse; **over 400 different types**
> - PTMs dysfunction can lead to ==pathophysiologies==, and may be hard to detect. 
> - Mass spec is great! because PTMs add mass, and mass spec is excellent at guaging accurate masses. of molecules.

> >- "There are more than 400 types of protein post-translational modifications. The common PTMs include phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, methylation and acetylation.[4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cjoc.202000515?casa_token=DDRr73PXckgAAAAA%3A-AG2zXpbYebTHEB-LRE-wa5mtyibzf5lRUBx7jjq-YlI9ILLG7DkQvq_sQ-DLLSuLI1kFCrB3Yyjrf4#cjoc202000515-bib-0004)"

> [!example] Limitations in context of PTMs
> - PTMs characterised by **low abundance, low stoichiometry** and **wide dynamic range**
> - -> PTM main challenge is our confidence to identify them, due to **interference**
> - Low abundance PTMs need better MS methods for quant and qual analysis.
> - Also PTM proteome can be **enriched** based on PTM category properties (==hydrophobicity, charge density, lability==)

> > "Due to the low abundance of most PTMs proteins/peptides, the analysis of modified proteins/peptides is usually interfered by non-modified proteins/peptides. Therefore, it is still urgent to develop new mass spectrometry related methods to achieve more reliable qualitative and quantitative analysis of low abundance PTMs.[7](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cjoc.202000515?casa_token=DDRr73PXckgAAAAA%3A-AG2zXpbYebTHEB-LRE-wa5mtyibzf5lRUBx7jjq-YlI9ILLG7DkQvq_sQ-DLLSuLI1kFCrB3Yyjrf4#cjoc202000515-bib-0007)"
