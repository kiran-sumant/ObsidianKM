==***PRACTICE PRACTICE***==

> [!important] Presentation Structure
> - Overall significance
> - Relevant Background
> - ==Aims + hyp==
> - Research Plan
> - ***==Detailed critique of methods used, and alternative methods==***
> - Data generated so far (confirm MFAP2 O-fucosylation, optional though) can include as demonstration of methods

- ==Leave some stuff out==
- Pick details that best tells your "story" (quantity, quality, context)

What does the audience ***need*** to know? consider the research gap and other aspects of the showcase project.

## Table of contents:

| Section    | Time     |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Background | 3-5 mins |

- ==make the problem real, especially chronic illnesses.==

- Aims should be logical and perfectly described
- Link to each other and to background material
> [!warning] 
> Dont just  state the hypotheses, you need to **present them** (add glitter for effect)
> can use contrast colours (minor innovation)
> Aims can come with associated diagrams


> [!summary] Idea for Hypothesis and aims
> - Overview of O-fucosylation in diagram
> - {==zoom in==} Target the specific FUT10/11 pathway/mechanism
> - Highlight parts of the process we are investigating with associated aim/hypothesis 




Methodology Critique

- Hek293 Cell Models

- Colabfold, Foldclass, Foldseek

- Liquid chromatogram type

- ==Mass Spec DDA and PRM== In-depth
	- stengths, weaknesses
	- alternatives?
- Byonic/Maxquant use


Try not to finish too abruptly, give **2 slides** for the ==summary==.

# Addressing Target audience

- Medical science students in similar/adjacent fields, + supervisors.
- ==No need to over-de-technicalisation==, but need to identify niche etymology that'll need to be expanded on.
