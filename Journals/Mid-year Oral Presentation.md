![[SOMS 4102 2024 (S2) Oral Presentation Marking Rubric-1.pdf]]

Keep note: need to make suggestions for alternative methods!!

After 4 talks, assessors discuss then give feedback.

==***PRACTICE PRACTICE***==

> [!important] Presentation Structure
> - Overall significance
> - Relevant Background
> - ==Aims + hyp==
> - Research Plan
> - ***==Detailed critique of methods used, and alternative methods==***
> - Data generated so far (confirm MFAP2 O-fucosylation, optional though) can include as demonstration of methods

- ==Leave some stuff out==
- Pick details that best tells your "story" (quantity, quality, context)

What does the audience ***need*** to know? consider the research gap and other aspects of the showcase project.

## Table of contents:

| Section    | Time     |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Background | 3-5 mins |

- ==make the problem real, especially chronic illnesses.==

- Aims should be logical and perfectly described
- Link to each other and to background material
> [!warning] 
> Dont just  state the hypotheses, you need to **present them** (add glitter for effect)
> can use contrast colours (minor innovation)
> Aims can come with associated diagrams


> [!summary] Idea for Hypothesis and aims
> - Overview of O-fucosylation in diagram
> - {==zoom in==} Target the specific FUT10/11 pathway/mechanism
> - Highlight parts of the process we are investigating with associated aim/hypothesis 




Methodology Critique

- Hek293 Cell Models

- Colabfold, Foldclass, Foldseek

- Liquid chromatogram type

- ==Mass Spec DDA and PRM== In-depth
	- stengths, weaknesses
	- alternatives?
- Byonic/Maxquant use


Try not to finish too abruptly, give **2 slides** for the ==summary==.

# Addressing Target audience

- Medical science students in similar/adjacent fields, + supervisors.
- ==No need to over-de-technicalisation==, but need to identify niche etymology that'll need to be expanded on.
- w/ complex visual presentation, use highlighting to focus visual of audience.

***be confident in your slides***. avoid excessive text. avoid mixing photos and text.

in practicing, go slow and see how fast it goes.
audience engagement, get in the middle of the room, walk around, rizz 'em with the 'tism.

==***never read script***==

# Answering questions

- ask to clarify questions, if you ==don't know the answer== **say so and move on**
- Refer to literature or unpublished work from lab.
- ![[Pasted image 20240629200719.jpg]], **don't waffle**

# Formatting
- referencing: 10-12 pt size
- Only refer to work of others shown in the presentation, aka diagrams.

# Acknowledgement slide
1. Institute logos
2. names of lab members
3. collaborators
4. personal touch (? we should get a lab group photo heh)

# ==OTD==
Check details
Arrive early
Familiarise yourself with pointer
