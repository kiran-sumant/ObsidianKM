Translating my academic skills to a non-academic career interview:

- ==Translating== your skills for a **non-academic audience** is key to your success
- Understand what employers are looking for
- Speak the interviewer's language - present yourself and your ==capabilities== in a **language** that your prospective employer can understand and ==*relate*== to
- ==Frame== your experience according to **skills**, rather than ~~knowledge~~. What did you actually do?
- Be confident about telling the **story of your transition** out of higher education and into a new sector of work.

## Behavoural Questions

- Describe a situation when you needed to persuade others to take up your idea? How did you convince them to agree with you?
- Can you give an example when you have taken the initiative to make an improvement to a process?
- Tell us about a situation in which you had to adjust to changes over which you had no control. How did you handle it?
- Describe a situation where you were faced with competing demands to multiple deadlines. How did you manage your workload?

## Situational Questions (most common in finance)

- Questions are developed around the **competencies being assessed**
- ==Take your time== to think about your answer
- Tell the interviewer what **assumptions** you are **making**
- In your answer include ==WHAT== you would do and ==WHY== you would do it that way
