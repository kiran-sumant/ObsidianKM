Translating my academic skills to a non-academic career interview:

- ==Translating== your skills for a **non-academic audience** is key to your success
- Understand what employers are looking for
- Speak the interviewer's language - present yourself and your ==capabilities== in a **language** that your prospective employer can understand and ==*relate*== to
- ==Frame== your experience according to **skills**, rather than ~~knowledge~~. What did you actually do?
- Be confident about telling the **story of your transition** out of higher education and into a new sector of work.
