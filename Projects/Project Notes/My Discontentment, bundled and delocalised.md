"Take a distance from the discontentment, take it outside. Bundle it, and view it as an observer. Show yourself that you are not your mind"

What is my mind? Where is my mind?

My discontentment:

- Not diagnosed with ADHD. the diagnosis would have given me an escape from my current lifestyle.
- Frustrated with how relieved I feel about not being diagnosed, because while I fit all the criteria now, I didn't do so as a child. It means I avoid the risks that come with medication being abvailable, but perhaps that the problem requiring treatment will never be addressed otherwise.
