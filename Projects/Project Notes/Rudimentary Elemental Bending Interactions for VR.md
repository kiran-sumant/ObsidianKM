# Earth
- Object-interaction based
- Push, Ground, Block, Impact
- Kung-fu based movesets with karate influence
- Systematic, movements projected, high impact high defense. (size and/or fundamental momentum of rocks summoned can increase with skill level)
- Slower, movements projected, high impact high defense
- Momentum determines object motion, setting up more complex moves requires more finesse rather than time. Therefore skill gap success heightens exponentially.

# Fire
- Breathing based mechanisms, Power output based
- Punch, Slash, Propel, Force out
- Karate-based movements with shaolin influence
- Character breathing changes with stamina. 
- Timing of movements must synchronise with breathing. Stamina reduce increases breath rate but reduces power output. 
- Large movements, automatically store breath for delayed result but exponential impact. (breath capacity can increase with skill level)

# Air
- Flow-manipulation based
- Redirect, Slow, Immobilise, Blast
- Wing Chun style movements
- Able to stun opponents with sound (potential skill tree application)
- Using flow and rhythm of wind to push and stun, rather than hurt. Power moves can do significant damage, but mainly knockback to kick people out of the ring.
- Different speeds and agilities of mobility can increase with skill level.

# Water
- Flow-interaction based
- Redirect, Block (ice), Propel/slide, Lash
- Taichi-based movements, mixed in with a little Kungfu for ice manipulation
- Can heal (takes time, potential skill tree application)
- One hand controls the path of the water, the other hand controls how far away the water is relative to the holder (proportion calculations, how fast can they run?)
- At terminal velocity provided by bending acceleration or water falling, hand to direct distance becomes hand to control water's state (liquid or ice, open hand vs closed for instance)
- can use earth bending moves on still water to create Ice defences (temporary ice wall, ice disk but icicles that need to accelerate before firing)
- Ice and waves can be used for advantage mobility or disadvantage mobility (slippery area, pushing closer to the edge with wave)
