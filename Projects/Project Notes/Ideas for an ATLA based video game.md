## Player-Player socialisation

Student-Sifu relationship: create a sifu hierarchy for the top players. Novice students pay ingame currency for the opportunity to be taught.

**Dojo-space** top-100 players must remain active t keep their rank. **Duels** need to occur (best of 5) in order to rank higher. refusal to honour a duel results in demotion. Only allowed to request duel from your immediate superior.

Coins earned through quests or matches.

Sifus also have a ranking determined by student successes. Score behaves as follows:
- consider same scoring metric used for impact score in journals
- chronologically sensitive (adjust for every month/season so ratings can increase and not depend on past performance unless students activity is reduced)

Less about factions, more about schools. (schools can have respective aesthetics through)

| Element | Duel name                                |
