## Player-Player socialisation

Student-Sifu relationship: create a sifu hierarchy for the top players. Novice students pay ingame currency for the opportunity to be taught.

**Dojo-space** top-100 players must remain active to keep their rank. **Duels** need to occur (best of 5) in order to rank higher. refusal to honour a duel results in demotion. Only allowed to request duel from your immediate superior.

Coins earned through quests and/or matches.

Sifus also have a ranking determined by student successes. Score behaves as follows:
- consider same scoring metric used for impact score in journals
- chronologically sensitive (adjust for every month/season so ratings can increase and not depend on past performance unless students activity is reduced)

## The Fights

Less about factions, more about schools. (schools can have respective aesthetics through)

For the separate elements, each duel type can have lore/fanon accurate names:

| Element | Duel name                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Fire    | Agni Kai                                 |
| Water   | Anakisaaqua (pun on anakisaaq- and aqua) |
| Rock    | Lei Tai                                  |
| Air     | Sparring                                 |
| Mix     | Pro Bending Match                        |

## Player Characterisation

- (inspired by Deep rock galactic): All players have access to all elements, under different customisable characters. 
- (perhaps) players can choose main element to start with, then upskill to unlock new "partners" to become part of their team. 
- Could be campaign based unlock in deeper playthrough, but for now best to attribute to quest completion or completion of achievements (similar to perk points but maybe exponential unlock costs from 2nd to 3rd and 4th elements)
- Facial features entirely customisable, body type customisable within parameters (oh god we're gonna get some funny people rocking up to Capital city).
- Clothes based on locality of origin in the beginning, can change outfits with coin. A collection of set outfits can be attributes to each "major" region, if we want to go further can also create starting outfits based on character lore (aristocrat or military upbringing vs peasant/bandit)
