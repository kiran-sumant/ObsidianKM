# Machine Learning (ML)
## Data Investigation

Using ==expert intuition== to advise on features for a model is how it usually is done in order to figure out prognosis/diagnosis.

ML methods can take MANY factors from an EMR, clean and process from hundreds of data inputs in order to model and identify specific conditions that help.

We need to know ==how and when== to apply ML to use it effectively.

## Preliminaries
Example:- 
Single data instance; a row.

Label:-
Ground Truth or ==*predicted value*== assigned to outcome/condition of interest.

Features:- 
Used to train an predict and outcome in a dataset

Classification task:- 
structure of "solution" necessary to create model that creates predictions from features.

Training Data:- 
Used to tune hyperparameters of ML model.
