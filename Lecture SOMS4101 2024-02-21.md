# Machine Learning (ML)
## Data Investigation

Using ==expert intuition== to advise on features for a model is how it usually is done in order to figure out prognosis/diagnosis.

ML methods can take MANY factors from an EMR, clean and process from hundreds of data inputs in order to model and identify specific conditions that help.

We need to know ==how and when== to apply ML to use it effectively.

## Preliminaries
Example:- 
Single data instance; a row.

Label:-
Ground Truth or ==*predicted value*== assigned to outcome/condition of interest.

Features:- 
Used to train an predict and outcome in a dataset

Classification task:- 
structure of "solution" necessary to create model that creates predictions from features.

Training Data:- 
Used to tune hyperparameters of ML model.

**Note**: **Unsupervised learning** is usually about only ==finding natural groups==, while **Supervised learning** is about figuring out ==predictions for an outcome of interest==.

Unsupervised is aided by ==clustering== and ==[[Dimensionality Reduction]]==

==***Interpretability*** ==
Interpretability will pop up on assessment.
- Need to express in model with features are more important.
- "ML method is a black box" models only tell us about the end result. Doesn't tell us what the principal components map into on the classification scatter graph.
- Need to use models where ==explainability== is maintained. **==Random forest==** is best example of one where we can go back and explain our features.



# Feature Representation
## Transforming Data
Binary, categorical (nominal or ordinal), Numerical

[[One-Hot Encoding]]


## Training and Testing through Cross-Validation
- Train on 90%
- Test on the other 10%
- Repeat to build and choose models that ==avoid overfitting==, avoids super correlation.

## Performance Measures
Accuracy may be important in model performance. ***However,*** focus on accuracy alone may create **imbalance** in the dataset.
[[Data Imbalance]] is seen as in linked.
